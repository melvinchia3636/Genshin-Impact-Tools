                "Xiao is a yaksha who has fought in the Archon War and holds a high level of seniority among adepti. He has a reserved demeanor and has little intention of getting close to mortals. He does not want sympathy for his past and believes his fellow Yakshas would also find it insulting.\n",
                "As a way to repay his gratitude to the Geo Archon, Xiao dedicates his life into ensuring the safety of Liyue and its citizens, but he has hardly set foot in the city he protects and is seldom involved with mortal affairs. Due to also suffering from karmic debt, he prefers to be alone and not burden others. To others, he can come off as distant and intimidating.\n",
                "Xiao is unfamiliar with many human customs and societal norms, often finding them strange, childish, or pointless. After the events of the story, Xiao maintains his same dedication to Liyue, but becomes more willing to learn more about mortal customs for the sake of the Traveler. He even offers to visit the Harbor with the Traveler together. He is also revealed to be a strict yet effective teacher when acting as a mentor figure for Ganyu, but he believes that as a soul-slaughtering yaksha, he is not a suitable teacher for her.\n"

Xiao also has a purple diamond marking on his forehead, and a green tattoo around his right arm.\n",
            "Xiao wears a white sleeveless shirt with subtle cloud patterns. It has a high black collar with golden accents, with it's left side extending further to cover his shoulder. He wears baggy dark purple pants, and wears dark purple boots overtop. Xiao has black and dark turquoise gloves with gold decals and a necklace. Around his left arm, Xiao wears a white and gold sleeve with a red lining. He notably carries an Anemo vision on his left glove and is usually seen carrying his Yaksha mask on the back of his right hip.\n",
            "Xiao's original Illuminated Beast form may be related to the Vedic deity Garuda, one of Xiao's character inspirations. Xiao is also known as the golden-winged king, his namesake Alatus, though this form has yet to be seen in-game. His arm tattoo supposedly is a reflection of his true form, and it is the rough silhouette of an upside-down bird. His outfit, Endurer of Eons, is described to be Classical and battle-wear fit for a thousand years of evil-conquering.\n"
