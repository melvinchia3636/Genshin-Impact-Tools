She is also a bit of a troublemaker, as she has had her gliding license revoked numerous times. She is not good at cooking, as she is known to cause accidents in the kitchen and the food she makes is subpar.\n"

                "Each day, she burns with a fiery enthusiasm that sees her go about her life like a whirlwind, smashing through any obstacle that stands in her way.",
                "At times, however, her excessive energy can make her quite the troublemaker.",
                "Needless to say, she was quite a handful when she was young. Her infamous deeds include accidentally dropping a bird's nest on her **Amber's Grandfather|grandpa's** head while trying to steal the eggs from it and setting a Dendro slime's leaves on fire, causing it to scurry about like a wild animal. These minor offenses gained her some notoriety among hunters' camps.",
                "Somehow, Amber was always able to escape the scene of the crime whenever she caused an incident, and not even a veteran outrider could catch up with her. Invariably, it was Amber's grandpa who ended up on damage control duty each time his granddaughter's misbehavior caused yet another incident.",
                "To Amber, her grandpa's silent, unconditional love was like a warm breeze that wrapped around her like a blanket. She knew that it was because of this love that he accepted her and took responsibility for her deeds, and she embraced it silently.",
                "But it was only on the day her grandpa resigned from the Knights of Favonius that she finally understood the full extent of the responsibility he had borne all those years."

                "Amber's grandpa was once the leader of a mercenary group. He came from **Liyue Harbor** and was tasked with protecting merchant caravans as they traversed **Teyvat**. One day, on a routine escort job, the caravan fell prey to a savage monster attack; he was the only survivor, saved by a doctor from the Knights of Favonius.",
                "Too ashamed to return home and anxious to repay the debt, Amber's grandpa joined the Knights of Favonius.",
                "Before long, he single-handedly founded the Outriders, trained each of them personally, and began leading them on missions. It also wasn't long before he found love in the foreign land of Mondstadt and founded a family.",
                "Years later, Amber was born into that family. During the day she would crouch by the window and secretly watch him training the outriders; at night, she would sneak into the yard and practice the moves he had taught that day.",
                "Amber's grandpa was touched by her enthusiasm, and decided to teach her everything he knew. \"When Mondstadt accepted me, it became my homeland. Then I decided to watch over this new home of mine. Maybe one day, you will inherit this responsibility... Hah, but then, who knows what the future holds?\"",

                "Something happened one day four years ago that profoundly changed Amber.",

                "He had been the beating heart and the backbone of the Outrider division, and without his leadership they rapidly became undisciplined and lost their edge.",
                "A few failed operations later, the Outrider division was facing obsoletion. In the end, it was preserved as a part of the Knights' organization, but in name only. Experienced members either transferred to another detachment or resigned, and so few outriders stayed that they simply did not have enough people to fulfill their daily patrol duties.",
                "On top of this, rumors that Amber's grandpa had defected made recovery even more difficult for the struggling Outrider division.",
                "Amber personally experienced this entire episode, having just been admitted to the Outriders before it all began. With the decline of her squad, she experienced true loss and disappointment for the first time in her life. No longer her carefree former self, she was filled with a new determination: She was going to grow up and become a true outrider as quickly as possible, no matter what it took.",
                "She had never made an actual plan before, and lacked the maturity to know where to start. But what she did have was confidence and courage &mdash; and lots of it.",
                "She wanted to show she had inherited her grandpa's determination, and she wanted to find out where he had gone.",
                "But more importantly, she wanted to inherit her grandpa's former role and become a loyal protector of her homeland."

                "Life in the Knights of Favonius was not easy for Amber in the beginning.",
                "Being as young as she was and having just lived through the trauma of losing her grandpa, the senior knights made a point of taking care of her. However, for a girl as desperate to excel as she was, being taken care of by others implied that she wasn't yet mature enough to stand on her own two feet. Accordingly, she voraciously sought out extra responsibilities and made this as visible as possible to her seniors.",
                "Finally, during an intense engagement with some monsters, the seniors noticed her bravery and resourcefulness in the heat of battle.",
                "That was the moment when they realized their little girl was growing up.",
                "As she matured, she also became more at ease with herself. Whatever feedback she was met with, be it praise, rebuke, silence or taunting, her response was the same.",
                "\"For sure, I may still have a way to go before I catch up with my seniors. But one day, I'm gonna be the best Outrider ever!\"",
                "Amber is not prone to too much deliberation, preferring instead to speak her mind, truthfully and frankly, at every occasion.",

But I've been chasing it for three days, and I've only been able to sit down for a proper meal today. That magical bird was a really cunning one, burrowing in the thick forest like that. Good thing I didn't give up! Best of all, Master Jean gave me special permission to pluck a feather plume from it as a reward. Hehe, I'll wear it at my side every single day!\"",
