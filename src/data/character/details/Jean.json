                "After centuries of basking in the bliss of the thousand winds, this sapling grew into a towering tree. Jean was conferred the title of \"Dandelion Knight\" at the age of fifteen. The title of Dandelion Knight is also known as Lionfang Knight. Passed down through generations of knights, the title is bestowed upon only the most distinguished.",
                "On the day she received the title, Jean excused herself from the celebrations that followed the conferment ceremony. As if following in the footsteps of her childhood hero, she went and stood before the great tree. The title of Dandelion Knight symbolizes Vennessa's legacy of resistance and benevolence. So how, Jean thought, could one such as herself be worthy of this honorable title?",
                "More than a millennium had passed since Mondstadt's restoration. Did she really have what it would take to continue to protect this ancient and proud land of freedom? Beneath her outwardly mature visage lay the heart of a young girl, who had only just received the title and remained wholly unprepared for the task that lay before her. The wind blew from far away, and she felt it flow within her as it gently whisked away her doubts and worries, leaving her with an unwavering determination:",

                "To become a warrior as kind and as determined as Vennessa; to fight for her people and for freedom... Yes, this was the true meaning of her simple family motto. To this day, whenever Jean feels weary or feels herself beginning to waver, she comes and stands before this tree and lets the wind console her once more. It carries away her fatigue, so that she may once more have the strength to carry on.",

When he came to Mondstadt, he dusted off his past self and started anew with the **Church of Favonius**, and ascended to high office within it, becoming known as the Cardinal of Daybreak. The two lovers eventually parted ways. Young Jean, holding her mother's hand, would watch the silhouettes of her father and her sister, **Barbara**, grow ever more distant.",
                "Later, Barbara would follow in her father's footsteps and join the Church of Favonius, becoming a deaconess much beloved by the people. Jean has always wanted to get closer to her younger sister by blood, but cannot bring herself to say anything when faced with Barbara's evasive eyes. Perhaps all-too-similar awkwardness is a sign that the sentiment is shared.",

                "No matter how many times she has read the historical classics, despite her title of Dandelion Knight, and though she has become the Acting Grand Master whom everyone relies on... Jean still loves romance novels. This is not for the years as a young girl that she missed amid her training and duties, or due to the rift that formed in her parents' marriage.",
