                "At first glance, Hu Tao appears to be a quirky and cheerful girl. She enjoys pranking people and despises sitting around and doing nothing, as she wishes to live her life to the fullest. Her eccentric and off-the-wall personality often leaves people with a negative impression of her, especially Qiqi, who states that she has a \"punchable face\" and should be stored in the fridge. In contrast, Xiao likes her humor, finding it irritating but interesting.\n",
                "On the other hand, when handling funerals and last rites, she becomes more solemn and constantly reminds her employees to never deviate from the client's requests. Due to the importance and traditions of the parlor's duties, she also expresses a distaste towards people treating her or her employees with suspicion whenever they go to work at night.\n",
                "Despite her negative impressions, she knows about Liyue's hidden secrets and past and is suspicious of Zhongli's true identity. Hu Tao accepts death as a natural part of life and tells others to enjoy their short lives. She also loathes those who try to prolong their natural lifespan, such as Baizhu. She also appears to show a lack of interest in her Pyro Vision.\n"

It is parted with a zig-zag pattern and tied up into high pig-tails, hidden and held down by her hat. She wears a dark brown porkpie hat, decorated with red plum blossoms and branches, along with an indigo tassel and a wooden talisman attached to the front.\n",
            "Hu Tao wears a traditional red shirt with a mandarin collar, a black coat, and black shorts with gold accents. Her Pyro Vision is embedded at the back of her coat, along with long rectangular coattails, a black collar and cuffs, and golden brooches attached underneath her coat's collar and waist. She wears a pair of white socks with matching red blossoms along with low-heeled dress shoes. Her fingernails are painted black, and she wears multiple rings. Her left hand has rings on the index and middle, while her right has the middle, index, and thumb. She wears a loose red bracelet on her right hand, though her long sleeves usually hide it. Her outfit, Plum Blossom Bouquet, is described to be the daily work clothes of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's director.\n"
