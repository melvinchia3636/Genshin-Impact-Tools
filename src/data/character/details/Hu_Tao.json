She enjoys pranking people and despises sitting around and doing nothing, as she wishes to live her life to the fullest. Her eccentric and off-the-wall personality often leaves people with a negative impression of her, especially Qiqi, who states that she has a \"punchable face\" and should be stored in the fridge. In contrast, Xiao likes her humor, finding it irritating but interesting.\n",

Due to the importance and traditions of the parlor's duties, she also expresses a distaste towards people treating her or her employees with suspicion whenever they go to work at night.\n",
                "Despite her negative impressions, she knows about Liyue's hidden secrets and past and is suspicious of Zhongli's true identity. Hu Tao accepts death as a natural part of life and tells others to enjoy their short lives. She also loathes those who try to prolong their natural lifespan, such as Baizhu. She also appears to show a lack of interest in her Pyro Vision.\n"

Her Pyro Vision is embedded at the back of her coat, along with long rectangular coattails, a black collar and cuffs, and golden brooches attached underneath her coat's collar and waist.

Her left hand has rings on the index and middle, while her right has the middle, index, and thumb. She wears a loose red bracelet on her right hand, though her long sleeves usually hide it. Her outfit, Plum Blossom Bouquet, is described to be the daily work clothes of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's director.\n"
