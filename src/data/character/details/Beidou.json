                "She is a reliable and strong captain, getting along well with her entire crew, prioritizing the interests of her ship and crew first above everything else. In part due to her time in the seas, she can easily read people in an instant and shows no fear against powerful entities, having defeated the leviathan Haishan without a vision, something that Xiao notes as remarkable. She often breaks the rules in Liyue, resulting in hefty fines from the Tianquan, but she does not appear to mind paying despite having lost a significant amount of Mora doing so.\n",

The top of her hair is tied up with an intricate gold hairpin with a pale blue tassel hanging from one end. Her fringe parts around her right eye, slightly covering her left. Her right eye is a deep ruby-colored hue melting into gold, reminiscent of a brilliant dawn. The radiance in her gaze could challenge that of the sun. Her left eye is covered by a red eyepatch. From her left ear dangles an earring resembling two hollow diamonds stacked upon each other, the color of which matches with her hairpin.\n",
            "Her outfit, Rolling Waves, is described to be lightweight clothing saturated with a brave seafarer's spirit.\n",
            "She dons a black leotard underneath a bright red sleeveless qipao dress, with side slits going up to her hips and the chest area cut out. In stark contrast to the rest of her primarily red ensemble, a vivid purple Electro Vision is chained below her left breast, from which hangs a golden tassel. Beidou also wears an imposing fur-lined red shawl around her shoulders. The back of her qipao dress splits into two, with gold cloud patterns embroidered at the end, accentuated by black bordering. Additionally, she wears a pair of fingerless, elbow-length black gloves. Beidou's boots reach up to her thighs and boast high heels strong enough to kick a claymore into the air with. Many golden anchor motifs can be found scattered around Beidou's outfit, such as on her boots, her gloves, and the front of her qipao dress.\n"
