She has a very high standard of work ethic, as she always strives to ensure that everyones' needs are satisfied and always makes the effort to go over their expectations. No work is a problem for her; Lisa believes that the more work she is given, the happier she is.\n",
                "Despite this, she is relatively stubborn and inexperienced; she states that she is useless in an argument and simply does what she believes is best, regardless of the other party's advice. Likewise, her attempts to meet everyone's needs is double-edged; although most people are genuine, others can take advantage of her generosity. Jean also considers her to be eligible for the Knights, but refrains from knighting her because she is worried that she is not ready for what lies outside Mondstadt.\n",
                "She looks up to all of the Knights and asks them for advice on how to be a proper member when she officially joins, regardless of how much experience they may have, such as the rambunctious Klee. Her aspiration of joining them means that she will refuse any other invitations offered to her.\n"

            "As for wear, Noelle has the typical maid ensemble with the exception of a priestess hat, a cravat, and many roses, which she wears as to remind herself to never leak confidential information. Her crimson dress has two bows, one at her hip and the other on her rear, the latter of which her Geo Vision is sat on top of. Gilded white armor plating adorns her chest and she wears a pauldron upon her left shoulder. She also wears black tights beneath her armored boots. Her outfit, Armored Rose, is described to be heavy and durable velvet and metal plates.\n"

                "All the child needed to do was scream, and Noelle appeared.",
                "She put the cabinet down on its back, took a plate out, and handed it to the child, reminding him not to have cold drinks immediately after having barbecue. Then she righted the cabinet, cleaned up the other plates, and then put them back in order.\nNoelle's ability to be everywhere all at once is something miraculous to many.",
                "However, the job of a maid is no myth or legend. Noelle only does her job to the letter.",

                "If you were to ask her how to build a campfire as she passed by, she would not only stop and build the campfire for you, she would also put up the grill racks, season the food, cook it for you, taste it herself to make sure it's done, and remind you to put out the fire when you've finished so as not to burn the forest down. Then she would get back to whatever she had been doing beforehand.",
                "Of course, most people don't mind at all that she regularly goes the extra mile. But sometimes, it can produce unexpected results...",
                "For example, a **Landa|merchant** from **Snezhnaya** once came to **Mondstadt**, ostensibly wishing to get into the winery business. In truth, he had an evil plot to ruin the land, destroy the winery business in Mondstadt altogether and then seize the market with wines from Snezhnaya.",
                "He disguised himself as an honest merchant with his family on a business trip to Mondstadt.",
                "Naturally, with them being visitors from afar, Noelle gave them a warm reception.",
                "Initially, the merchant was delighted with Noelle's hospitality; it was a cut above the crude etiquette he had come to expect from most peasants in Mondstadt. However, after a while he began to feel something was amiss. Noelle seemed to be able to read his mind: She correctly guessed his schedule, cooked his family's favorite Snezhnayan dishes for them each day, and even knew that **Tia|his daughter** liked to go to bed hugging a ragdoll, presenting her with a hand-made doll she had sewn together herself.",
                "This spooked the merchant, and made him hesitant to execute the next phase of his plan. Noelle's warm smile now chilled the merchant to the bone; what else did she know, and what was she really planning?",
                "In the end, the merchant fled Mondstadt with his family.",
                "Noelle was upset for a few days, thinking she had somehow insulted her guests. Little did she know that all of Mondstadt was indebted to her for taking her job so seriously."

                "Most of the time, Noelle's reliability provides a comforting presence, but there are always exceptions.",
                "Once, she learned that an adventurer was trapped on **Dragonspine**, so she decided to mount a rescue by herself. The snowstorm that day was terribly fierce, wiping out any tracks left by humans as soon as they were made. It was impossible to find a safe route to proceed, to say nothing of saving the adventurer amidst the snow. However, Noelle persisted in searching for the adventurer and eventually found him inside a cave, suffering from severe hypothermia.",
                "At that time, her coat was completely soaked, and the water inside her bottle had turned into ice. Thirsty and hungry, Noelle still managed to carry the adventurer down on her back.",
                "The adventurer was saved, but Noelle, having over-exerted herself, laid in bed for three days straight, suffering from a high fever. Everyone in the **Knights of Favonius** barely slept out of concern for her during that period. Fortunately, Noelle recovered.",
                "It was not the first or second time that something similar had happened, and everyone was deeply worried for Noelle. In order to prevent Noelle from putting herself in harm's way again, **Jean** had to invent some safe jobs to keep Noelle busy. If something were to happen, then **Kaeya** would have to save the day.",
                "During the Stormterror threat, Noelle was also eager to resolve the threat at its source. However, Kaeya managed to arrange quite a few 'urgent matters' for her to attend to inside the city until it was all over."

                "Noelle's petite form does a good job of hiding her great strength.",
                "This does not just refer to her resoluteness or her indomitable spirit, but also her physical strength.",
                "Once, Lisa accidentally dropped her experimental apparatus under her bookshelf and troubled over whether she could remain decent while bending over to retrieve it. Noelle made it over in the nick of time, lifting the full bookshelf with only one hand - and not a single book fell out between her hefting it and putting it down.",
                "There was another incident in which several cargo-bearing carts were attacked by **Slimes#Pyro Slimes|Pyro Slimes** as they tried to pass through Mondstadt's side gate. As the owners were all in a panic, it was Noelle again who came to the rescue - hurling the carts - cargo and all, into the **Cider Lake**, before leaping into the water herself and retrieving every last item.",
                "Rumor has it that when Noelle was studying the blade, she nearly sent **Wagner** - who prided himself in his forging skills - into despairing seclusion. In all, he forged over ten different swords with different alloy compositions for Noelle, but all would lose their edge after a few uses.",
                "At first, Wagner thought Noelle unskilled, but eventually he found that the problem was more foundational: the swords just weren't strong enough. Putting his reputation on the line, Wagner finally made Noelle a sturdy and heavy **Claymores|claymore** that was further reinforced by her affinity for **Geo**. Only then was her weapon issue (barely) solved. But don't worry, Noelle won't use her superhuman strength unless the situation calls for it, as she is a pacifist at heart.",
                "They say, however, that very day Noelle received her **Favonius Greatsword|custom-made claymore**, she was set upon by a pair of drunken **Treasure Hoarders** who thought her a harmless lamb...",

                "During this time, Noelle, who always holds herself to a high standard, joins the volunteers in continuously cooking and serving food.",

                "The etiquette, swordsmanship, the lines she had memorized... had they all gone to waste? She remembered all the strong points of every official knight, but who would remember the hard work of a failure like her?",
                "She had never stopped aspiring to become a Knight of Favonius, but her exhausted body wouldn't let her get back on her feet like she normally would. She felt like someone who had spent days and nights traveling through an icy tundra.",
                "At that moment, the main gate of the Knights Headquarters were flung upon, and out walked Acting Grand Master Jean, who had just been in charge of the selection process.",
                "Without a thought, Noelle gave a precise knight's salute. Immediately, she knew that this was too abrupt a thing to do, and wondered what Jean might think of her. But just as she was wishing that there was some hole she might crawl into to flee, Jean stopped in her own tracks and returned the salute. After a moment's surprise, Noelle gave a strained smile, clumsy but pure.",
                "This was a lucky day that she would always remember, for she would receive recognition from two all-important sources this day: once from Jean, and the other from the gods. Her hard work has been remembered after all.",
                "From that day forward, **Vision** in hand, Noelle reaffirmed her belief that she would one day be able to don that armor. That she would be gentle and reliable &mdash; and yes, everywhere at once too."
