She has a very high standard of work ethic, as she always strives to ensure that everyones' needs are satisfied and always makes the effort to go over their expectations. No work is a problem for her; Lisa believes that the more work she is given, the happier she is.\n",
                "Despite this, she is relatively stubborn and inexperienced; she states that she is useless in an argument and simply does what she believes is best, regardless of the other party's advice. Likewise, her attempts to meet everyone's needs is double-edged; although most people are genuine, others can take advantage of her generosity. Jean also considers her to be eligible for the Knights, but refrains from knighting her because she is worried that she is not ready for what lies outside Mondstadt.\n",

Her crimson dress has two bows, one at her hip and the other on her rear, the latter of which her Geo Vision is sat on top of. Gilded white armor plating adorns her chest and she wears a pauldron upon her left shoulder. She also wears black tights beneath her armored boots. Her outfit, Armored Rose, is described to be heavy and durable velvet and metal plates.\n"
