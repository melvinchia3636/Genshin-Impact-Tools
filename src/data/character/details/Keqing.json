                "Keqing is a workaholic, demanding herself to work \"ten times harder than the average human\" and is abnormally progressive in work-related issues. She also has a strong sense of responsibility and will not stop until a task has been completed perfectly - and by her standards, that means everything related to that task is also resolved, which unsurprisingly causes her employees to have a high turnover rate. Despite her young age, Keqing does not mind working under laborious conditions as part of her duties as the Yuheng.\n",
                "Before Rex Lapis' departure from Liyue, Keqing was an adamant skeptic of the gods, believing that humans should deal with their own affairs. However, once the Qixing took on the former responsibilities of Rex Lapis, she gained new respect for him after realizing how much he had done for Liyue, but because she is known for openly defying the gods, she tries to hide the fact that she gained new respect for him. She now keeps a collection of Rex Lapis memorabilia in the name of \"self-reflection.\" Likewise, she was initially skeptical of Visions; when she obtained hers, she took it as a challenge and an insult, desperately trying to destroy it to no avail. She eventually realized her mistake and began appreciating it for its many usages.\n",
                "Outside of work, she enjoys shopping when she has the time to do so, and her favorite food is Golden Shrimp Balls. She is very attached to and reliant on her hairpins; being imbued with Electro energy, she can essentially do just about everything she needs when out in the wilderness with them. She also states that despite its weathered appearance, it is what gives it their charm.\n"

            "She wears a pale lavender top with a high violet collar and ruffled dark blue skirt, layered under a deep violet overcoat. The opening of her overcoat is marked by a golden ornament, which has white flowers and purple and gold-accented feathers attached. The pattern of the feathers resembles the ones on the dangling backs of her long sleeves. In addition, she wears a golden hairpin, a tasseled choker, and dark gloves with lavender trim. Her outfit, Piercing Thunderbolt, is described to be a formidable-looking dress made using luxurious materials.\n"
