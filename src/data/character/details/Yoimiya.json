It's held by an obi belt, and exposes the upper left section of her body. Her chest is wrapped up in sarashi, as are her left forearm and upper thighs, extending down to her right leg. Her black obi is tied in a neat knot but is also decorated with a red rope that's made into huge bow behind her. A smaller white rope is also added to secure the knot. She wears black socks and sandals, made with red strings and decoratively tied into bows at her ankles for both feet. Her right leg is armored with red plating and padded with a longer thigh-high sock underneath. The armor is tied to her leg at the knee with light blue fabric.\n",
            "Her outfit contains a multitude of accessories; she wears a red choker with a golden butterfly ornament, black stud earrings, a red beaded bracelet on her right hand and a black fingerless glove tied by a red ribbon on her left. There is a small flower tattoo near her left shoulder above the sarashi, and another similar tattoo patch around her upper left arm containing a red fish, more flowers and purple swirls. A festival pouch hangs from her waist on the left, and her vision is secured to her obi on her right.\n"
