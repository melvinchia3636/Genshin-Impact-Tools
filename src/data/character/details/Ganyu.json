Due to her age, she is very forgetful, and she often forgets important details which causes her much embarrassment. She is relatively sleepy and is very sensitive about both her horns and weight.\n"

The styling of her hair is, similar to Kaeya, easy to mistake for a ponytail, but it is not actually tied back by anything. Though she mostly resembles a human, she has dark red horns that bend back along her hair, similar to how a goat's horns look, with brighter red markings on them. Many people confuse it as a headdress, a misconception that Ganyu actively encourages. She has heterochromatic eyes whose irises are purple at the top and fade into pink and gold at the middle and bottom.\n",
            "Around her neck, she additionally wears a golden bell. Her outfit consists of a black body-suit with gold accents underneath a purple and white bodice with long ends similar to a tailcoat, with a separated pair of sleeves to match. The bodysuit meets at the back of her neck to make a bow. She has white heels with gold accents and gray bottoms, with red knots around her ankles. Her Cryo Vision rests on her left hip with a red cloverleaf knot. Her outfit, Frostdew Trail, is described to be as elegant clothing blessed by the mighty and illuminated adepti.\n"

                "The people understand that the new policies announced each year will change the dynamics of the market, yet none can comprehend how policy is plucked from complex meeting minutes and compiled into something easier on the human eye.",
                "As the secretary of **Yuehai Pavilion**, Ganyu undertakes many tasks that ordinary folk do not see. The calculations and data behind the Qixing's every decision in **Liyue**, as well as every ordinance and regulation that is announced, are all the meticulous work of Ganyu.",
                "Each daybreak she stands by the dock, enjoying her breakfast in silence. Even still, by the time the sun has fully risen, she will have returned to Yuehai Pavilion overlooking **Liyue Harbor#Yujing Terrace|Yujing Terrace**, to continue to fulfill her contract &mdash; one that she signed three thousand years ago with **Rex Lapis**."

                "Ganyu is not the secretary of any one leader in the Liyue Qixing but is instead the general secretary for the entire organization. Under her gentle exterior, Ganyu is as persevering as stone itself. This was something that Rex Lapis, the leader of the adepti, noticed very early on. Thus when the Liyue Qixing first emerged ages ago, Ganyu was their secretary.",
                "Through the years and the changes in the Qixing's roster, Ganyu has remained by their side as a constant. This has also meant the mountainous piles of paperwork from various departments and bureaus in Liyue have fallen upon Ganyu's shoulders. But though her workload has increased seven, a hundred, or even thousandfold, her sense of responsibility has never wavered. Someone once queried as to the source of her motivation and received an answer that was not quite congruous with the question.",

Later on, with a face as red as a tomato, she stammered her way through an unconvincing explanation, all the while apologizing profusely to Rex Lapis in her heart. Her colleagues guessed that there must be some reason for the mistake. Those who did not know her well saw that Rex Lapis did not mind, and thus paid the incident no attention.
