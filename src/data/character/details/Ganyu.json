The styling of her hair is, similar to Kaeya, easy to mistake for a ponytail, but it is not actually tied back by anything. Though she mostly resembles a human, she has dark red horns that bend back along her hair, similar to how a goat's horns look, with brighter red markings on them. Many people confuse it as a headdress, a misconception that Ganyu actively encourages. She has heterochromatic eyes whose irises are purple at the top and fade into pink and gold at the middle and bottom.\n",
            "Around her neck, she additionally wears a golden bell. Her outfit consists of a black body-suit with gold accents underneath a purple and white bodice with long ends similar to a tailcoat, with a separated pair of sleeves to match. The bodysuit meets at the back of her neck to make a bow. She has white heels with gold accents and gray bottoms, with red knots around her ankles. Her Cryo Vision rests on her left hip with a red cloverleaf knot. Her outfit, Frostdew Trail, is described to be as elegant clothing blessed by the mighty and illuminated adepti.\n"
