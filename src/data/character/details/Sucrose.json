However, she does not share the same issue when talking about bio-alchemy or Albedo. She reveres Albedo to the point that she considers him to be a true gentleman and maintains an excessively formal manner towards him, despite both of them being at a similar age.\n"

                "Despite her youth, she has already achieved some brilliant results. For example, she has been able to increase the nectar output of **Sweet Flower**s by 70% by irrigating them with a special potion. She has also developed a special spray that allows **Sunsettia**s to maintain their freshness for a whole month after being plucked from the branch.",
                "Even people who were initially suspicious of her research inclinations have come to acknowledge her exceptional talents in the field of alchemy after seeing such results.",
                "However, she merely considers these to be incidental steps on the path to a successful experiment, rather than the success itself. Her true aim is much more ambitious than this. It's a secret, and is also her little dream."

                "Bio-alchemy explores numerous lines of inquiry, all of which stem from Sucrose's questions about living things in the world. These questions, in turn, are born out of her insatiable curiosity, a faculty that is far more developed in her than in most.",
                "For instance, Sucrose's curiosity was once drawn to the sweet flower, accepted by most people as simply being a source of sugar.",
                "She wondered: Although sweetness is clearly the most readily identifiable feature of this plant, should that be grounds for limiting its application as we have tended to? Does it not merit further study?",
                "So, after a careful study of the various features of sweet flowers, she devised thirty-something distinct rearing plans along with numerous control groups to account for temperature and other environmental conditions.",
                "And yet, her experiment still underestimated just how many variations were possible. After the experiment began, Sucrose found herself with more questions rather than fewer, and the novel discoveries that her experiment yielded gave her inspiration for further research. Sucrose is incapable of leaving questions unattended to &mdash; it makes her restless, even guilty, to ignore it. Spurred on by this quirk of her temperament, her rearing plants grew in number to almost three hundred.",
                "The result was a whole new series of sweet flower strains: Some with thrice the number of flowers, some with heads five or six times the normal size that could even float in the wind, and some even producing a sweet-tasting fruit.",
                "Months of experimentation later, Sucrose had finally answered every last one of her questions pertaining to sweet flowers. As she finished writing up her research notes, she let out a long sigh of relief.",
                "Though she was physically and mentally exhausted, the sight of stack after stack of her bio-alchemical research volumes stretching around three walls of the room gave her a deep sense of joy and satisfaction."

In fact, the truth is quite the opposite: Sucrose is fascinated by absolutely everything that exists in the world. The only thing is, she finds the discipline of social interaction to be far more difficult to master than that of alchemy.",
                "In alchemy, the process of trial-and-error coupled with a determination to get the truth is sufficient to bring you to your answer eventually. But with interpersonal relationships, there is the added complication of having to factor in manners, moods, and other unquantifiable variables. To make things worse, there seems to be no room for an approach that relies heavily on making errors.",
                "Hence, Sucrose decided to avoid such variables at all costs and stick to her familiar methods in satisfying her curiosity.",
                "For instance, Sucrose had always been curious about whether she and Cat's Tail bartender **Diona**, both of whom have animal ears, had any shared ancestry. In fact, this was not a private matter, and most people would simply ask the question. But Sucrose was concerned that it would be a sensitive topic &mdash; she, for one, did not like people drawing attention to her ears.",
                "So, she resorted to the method she knew best: Observation.",
                "For one whole month, Diona constantly had an unnerving sense that someone was secretly watching her. She assumed that one of the tavern patrons was stalking her, and was none too happy about it.",

                "Bio-alchemy aside, Sucrose made one further discovery from this episode.",
                "That is to say, judging by the pair of cat-ear spectacles she made for herself after the event, it would appear that she has finally come to comprehend a certain uniquely feline variety of cuteness. She is too shy to wear them in public, however, and only puts them on when alone in her room."

                "This was a major bonus for her. Not only was she able to acquire an ample supply of the usual chicken and boar bones, but she also got her hands on a complete lizard skeleton and even a chunk of hilichurl leg bone still bearing fresh blood.",
                "Her eyes would light up with excitement at the sight of these strange and rare bones. She would thank **Katheryne** of the Adventurers' Guild profusely, bowing to her over and over.",

                "She breathed a sigh of relief when she found out the truth. Soon after this, people noticed that Sucrose had switched her cloth sack for a leather one. Perhaps she did this just because she was shy. Or perhaps it was to avoid arousing suspicion..."

                "First things first, let's get some breakfast: fried eggs, sausages, and a cup of coffee. Nothing new to report there. All of these were foods and beverages that she had previously researched, after all.",
                "Next, she thought, how about a little rest and relaxation in the sun with a good book? Again, nothing new to report: plenty of research shows this to be one of the most effective means of relaxation. There wasn't a book that she hadn't already read, and there wasn't a query that she hadn't already highlighted, looked into, and later annotated.",

                "She was desperate to throw herself at a research problem. It didn't matter what it was: She would have happily researched the potted plants on the terrace, even if nothing came of it. Anything just to pass the time. But wherever she looked &mdash; the Lamp Grass to her left, the Sweet Flower in front of her, or the Cecilia to her right &mdash; all she found were things that she had previously researched in exhaustive detail.",
