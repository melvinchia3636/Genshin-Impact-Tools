An exorcist from Liyue, Chongyun was born with excessive yang (positive) energy, which has proven to be both a help and a hindrance. It makes him a very effective exorcist, but it also means he has never seen a spirit for himself \u2014 they flee before he can even lay eyes on them. It has also made him particularly susceptible to any kind of heat or strong emotion, which leads to some rather... unexpected results."

                "Despite being an exorcist, Chongyun has yet to exorcise or even see a spirit with his own eyes \u2014 his excessive positive energy terrifies all spirits in range. He is a hard worker, expressing his disdain towards his positive energy, considering it to be a cheap trick, and trains despite this boon in the event that a spirit resists his excessive energy. He also doesn't show much fondness for his Cryo Vision, believing that vigorous training is the key to becoming stronger. His noble nature often means that whenever he is commissioned to exorcise spirits, he hesitates at the thought of accepting payment when he did nothing.\n",
                "Because of his excessive positive energy, Chongyun is very susceptible to everything that warms him up \u2014 fiery events, food, drinks, clothing and even the sun itself; even thinking about them can trigger a flare-up. If this occurs, Chongyun often enters a manic state in which he becomes exceptionally excited, friendly and illogical, although he may simply faint. While he has no memory of what he does in this state, he considers it to be embarrassing and apologizes for any damage he causes, but most people do not mind and are even impressed by his actions in said state.\n",
                "Chongyun is extremely desperate to prevent any sort of flare-up and will do anything to minimize the chances of one; indicated with him wearing lightweight, lightly-colored clothes, shows great self-control and only eats cold food, expressing a fondness for Inazuman dishes; when this is not available, he improvises on the go, such as his signature dish, which is his take on the original and popsicles. Possibly as a result of eating cold food often when Liyue food is known to be warm and spicy, he considers his food to be tasteless.\n",
                "Chongyun's attempts to restrain his excessive positive energy also means that he has very little free time of his own and even then, doesn't have much friends to begin with, has trouble picking up social cues and appears to have low self-esteem outside of exorcism. He usually hangs out with Xingqiu during his free time; despite being pranked by him on a daily basis, he does not mind too much about it.\n",

Under this, he wears a blue shirt with gold decals over white pants with gold cuffs, along with a dark navy undershirt. He also wears black and gold slippers. He has bandages around his right wrist and right ankle. He wears his Vision on the left side of his belt. A knotted tassel which matches his eyes hangs from the vision. His outfit, Pure Spirit, is described to be as a traditional thaumaturge's trappings.\n"
