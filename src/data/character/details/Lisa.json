Despite her position as Librarian, Lisa takes it somewhat haphazardly as she appears to be relatively bored dealing with the normal books, instead preferring those in the restricted section. She still takes the job seriously nonetheless, as she will personally go out to collect books that are long overdue, albeit in a way that she can still enjoy the smaller things in life.\n",
                "Her haphazard, carefree personality comes from her Vision, as while the gods gave it to her and she was sated with knowledge she wanted to learn, they did not tell her what the price was, and she began fearing the truth behind them. This in turn caused her to become rather paranoid, and she left Sumeru out of fear that she was paying too high a price for knowledge, relegating herself to categorization and management of the library, usually refusing to take any other duties.\n",
                "When Lisa becomes angered, the surrounding air near her becomes electrified in part due to her Electro Vision. Depending on the severity of what has angered her, she can either be simply irritated or become incredibly scary, the latter also causing her to dispense \"appropriate\" punishment.\n",

She wears a gold necklace with her Vision clasped to the collar of her dress.\n",
