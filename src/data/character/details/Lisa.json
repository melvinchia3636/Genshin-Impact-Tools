Despite her position as Librarian, Lisa takes it somewhat haphazardly as she appears to be relatively bored dealing with the normal books, instead preferring those in the restricted section. She still takes the job seriously nonetheless, as she will personally go out to collect books that are long overdue, albeit in a way that she can still enjoy the smaller things in life.\n",
                "Her haphazard, carefree personality comes from her Vision, as while the gods gave it to her and she was sated with knowledge she wanted to learn, they did not tell her what the price was, and she began fearing the truth behind them. This in turn caused her to become rather paranoid, and she left Sumeru out of fear that she was paying too high a price for knowledge, relegating herself to categorization and management of the library, usually refusing to take any other duties.\n",
                "When Lisa becomes angered, the surrounding air near her becomes electrified in part due to her Electro Vision. Depending on the severity of what has angered her, she can either be simply irritated or become incredibly scary, the latter also causing her to dispense \"appropriate\" punishment.\n",

She wears a gold necklace with her Vision clasped to the collar of her dress.\n",

                "It is known that Lisa chose to return to **Mondstadt** after two years of advanced study in Sumeru, but the reason for her decision is not."
            ],
            "Story 1": [
                "Lisa is tasked with managing and maintaining the vast collection of books in the Knights of Favonius library, as well as ensuring that their potions are always fully stocked.",
                "The only time that the citizens of Mondstadt see Lisa is when lending or returning library books.",
                "In both scenarios, they tend to encounter Lisa sitting at the counter like a languid cat, yawning as she signs books in and out.",
                "At times, her behavior causes people to doubt whether she is really up to the task of being the librarian for the illustrious Knights of Favonius.",
                "Nevertheless, it appears that she performs every task flawlessly, as her work consistently stands up to scrutiny."
            ],
            "Story 2": [
                "The fact that Cyrus of the Sumeru Academia frequently refers to Lisa as their \"best student in two hundred years\" is all that needs to be said about Lisa's accomplishments in her studies.",
                "From outlandish forbidden knowledge, to the handling of elementally infused flora, to the most efficient methods of distilling wine... where there is a body of knowledge, the chances are that Lisa is acquainted with it.",
                "This, paired with her ability to explain things clearly and concisely, makes Lisa the sensible person to approach for young knights and alchemists with burning questions.",
                "That is, provided they go and see her at an acceptable hour.",
                "To visit during unacceptable hours &mdash; such as in the morning while Lisa is sleeping in, or in the afternoon while she's enjoying her tea - can spell disaster for unsuspecting visitors."
            ],
            "Story 3": [
                "When people meet Lisa for the first time, they often find themselves overawed by the famous alumnus of Sumeru Academia.",
                "However, though her attitude to life may appear at first to be one of ruthless efficiency, it is in fact better understood as a product of her incorrigibly lazy nature, which drives her to avoid troublesome issues at all costs.",
                "By negotiating with **Kaeya**, she offloaded the job of restocking and dispensing medication to **Huffman** and **Swan**, and had **Flora** start sending **Donna** over to deliver herbs on a daily basis.",
                "The only tasks Lisa handles personally are the categorization and management of books and other documents.",
                "This is the one area where Lisa feels more comfortable handling the work herself rather than delegating it."

            "Story 4": [
                "When Lisa first joined the Knights of Favonius, the **Varka|Grand Master** sought to appoint her as Captain of the 8th Company.",
                "This was much of consternation of the company's Field Officer, **Nymph**, who resented the idea of an academic coming in at such high-ranking position.",
                "At Kaeya's suggestion, a practice combat session was arranged in which Lisa and Nymph would both display their magical proficiency.",
                "Two minutes into the session, Lisa graciously declined the captaincy on the grounds \"Nymph manifestly possesses the requisite ability to fulfill the role.\"",
                "For the whole year following, the Grand Master received a constant stream of referral letters from Nymph in relation to  the captaincy, and the only person ever in them was Lisa Minci.",
                "Eventually, the Grand Master began turning over the referral letters to Lisa directly, but every time, Lisa would come up with an excuse to decline the offer.",
                "Undoubtedly, the 8th Company would have been far stronger under her lead, but she deemed that a such a level of power was not only superfluous to requirements, it would also be risky for her in a way that most people could never appreciate.",
                "To be clear, Lisa is quite confident that she could handle any situation she came up against. However, additional danger means an additional workload &mdash; and that is something that she would never be able to accept."
            ],
            "Story 5": [
                "Having personally witnessed raving-mad scholars in the forests of Sumeru and powerful sages sitting underutilized advisory councils, Lisa realized what uninhibited erudition can really do to a person.",
                "It seemed such a high price to pay... How much did one have to sacrifice to attain the profoundest knowledge at all?",
                "Put off by this realization, Lisa decided to leave Sumeru.",
                "Since then, Lisa has always stopped short of taking things too seriously.",
                "\"Before demanding too many miracles from the gods, first consider if you are willing to pay the price they ask.\"",

            "Special Heating Cauldron": [
                "The Special Heating Cauldron is a purpose-built cauldron made to a design that no one in Mondstadt could understand. It features time-delay heating, semi-automated ingredient insertion, and temperature regulation functions.",
                "Lisa spent an enormous budget and commandeered the alchemy workshop for two full weeks in order to build this extraordinary piece of equipment.",
                "She boasts that the cauldron is capable of completing any precision heating task to perfection with a maximum of just two pulls of a lever.",
                "But her most common application for it is to brew tea and keep it at the optimal temperature while she is managing her books.",

                "After all, understanding the elements is essential to the study of magic, and practical experience is a far more useful means of acquiring this understanding than trying to assimilate the knowledge contained in dusty old books.",
