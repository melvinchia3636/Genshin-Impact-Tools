She adores anything that can blow up like her bombs, such as Amber's Baron Bunny. She acts like a typical energetic young child who loves playing with her friends. Unfortunately, her definition of playing usually involves explosives; she is particularly fond of \"fish blasting\", tossing bombs into lakes full of fish.\n",

                "While she is considered an official member of the Knights of Favonius, Klee's antics often get her into trouble. Like any child, she often tries to flee to avoid being reprimanded, but is eventually caught by Jean who sends her to solitary confinement to self-reflect. While she occasionally does try to do so, she almost always quickly forgets and instead uses the time to brainstorm new bombs and explosives.\n",
                "Klee loves her fellow knights, and is well-loved by them in turn. She is particularly fond of Kaeya and Albedo. Whenever she heads out of the city to play, she always follows the \"survival rules\" which Kaeya gave her. Albedo, on the other hand, is an older brother figure who takes care of her. She also loves her parents, although she hasn't seen them since they left her under the care of the Knights of Favonius while they travel.\n",

Attached to this bag is Dodoco, a furry, woodland animal-shaped pom-pom made by her mother and her Pyro Vision.
