He is later revealed to be the current vessel of the Geo Archon, Morax, who has decided to experience the world from the perspective of a mortal. After giving up his Gnosis, he retires from his position as an Archon and returns to his former identity as an Adeptus, although still under the guise of being a human. He currently works as a consultant of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor."

                "Zhongli is a calm, reserved, and polite man, who holds an air of nostalgia. He knows much about Liyue's history and culture in part due to his time as the Geo Archon; like Venti, he has many experiences and memories, as he was a god well before The Seven even existed. He holds philosophical ideas towards money and has great respect for Liyue's traditions, including those that have been forgotten or warped over time. Zhongli tends to be humble, being worried he comes off as a \"bourgeois parasite\".\n",
                "Zhongli tends to forget about Mora in transactions, agreeing to spend large sums of it without having any Mora on hand and even taking \"discounts\" as granted despite being an obvious scam. He often ends up relying on his acquaintances for financial support, such as the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor or Childe. Although he works for Hu Tao, he does not like her childish behavior.\n",
                "It is later revealed that Zhongli's \"carelessness\" stems from being the creator of Mora. With the Gnosis allowing him to create limitless Mora, he never had to worry about running low on his personal finances. Unfortunately, when he chose to live among mortals, he lacked the foresight to find an alternative for them to continue minting Mora in his absence, along with creating a retirement fund for himself. As a result, he shamelessly spends the Mora of others.\n"

        "appearance": [
            "Zhongli currently appears as a tall and slender young man with fair skin and a stern expression. His eyes are bright and sharp, amber in color with glowing yellow pupils set in the shape of diamonds. He wears red eyeliner on the lower lids of his eyes. When using Geo, his eyes become luminescent. His dark brown hair is styled in a windswept fashion with a longer fringe that hangs from the right side of his face. It fades to amber brown at the tips and is pulled back in a long ponytail that falls beyond his waist. When he is using his Geo abilities, his amber highlights glow. This appearance is also used in The Statues of The Seven's depiction of Rex Lapis around Liyue.\n",
            "His attire is elegant and form-fitting, consisting of a beige dress shirt, a brown and amber waistcoat, slim black trousers, black dress boots, and black gloves with twin silver archer rings on the thumbs. His neckpiece is a white tie pinned at the throat by an amber gemstone. His left ear is adorned with a jeweled tassel earring. Over everything, he wears a long dark brown tailcoat with dragon scale patterns, gold and silver accents, golden tassels, and Rex Lapis' diamond symbol on the back. Zhongli's clothes are decorated with diamond symbols found on his sleeves, belt, trousers, waistcoat buttons, and tailcoat buttons. Similarly to Venti, because he was an Archon with an innate Gnosis, the \"Vision\" embedded on his chain at the small of his back is nothing more than a fake.\n",
            "Previously, he appeared as a brown and amber Chinese dragon/qilin with gold accents known as the Exuvia. His outfit, Hermit of Mortal Life, is described to be his leisurewear of choice as the consultant of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.\n"

                "In **Liyue**'s traditional customs, \"receiving **adepti**\" and \"sending adepti off\" are equally important.",
                "The Hus of the **Wangsheng Funeral Parlor**, who have been in this business for 77 generations, are the masters of handling funerals. However, **Hu Tao**, the current owner of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, primarily focuses on the art of sending mortals on their way.",
                "For the various ceremonies for sending adepti off, Hu Tao usually employs the help of a friend in more or less the same business. That person's name is Zhongli. The adepti have been with Liyue for millennia, but only a handful have ascended in the past three thousand years, which means that everything regarding the traditions now only exists in texts. This is not something one would likely witness twice in their entire lifetime.",
                "Not even the most particular and learned of researchers or scholars could find one fault in Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's ceremonies for sending adepti off.",
                "Everything must be perfect, from the costumes, the time, the place, the items, the weather, the scheduled length, the size of the permitted audience, to the stature, profession, and age of the said audience. Nothing can be overlooked.",
                "When folk describe Zhongli as \"living history,\" the latter usually only smiles and sighs.",
                "\"I... just have a good memory.\""

            "Story 1": [
                "In Liyue, if a person pays great attention to details, and has insuperable criteria by which they judge certain matters, then they are called \"particular.\"",
                "In truth, everyone is \"particular\" about something. Some people hate spicy food, others don't eat fish, and some want their tofu served sweet...",
                "But as for Zhongli, he is particular about everything. He must attend operas by the most celebrated performers, take the most luxuriant thrushes out for walks, and he must go into the kitchen personally to instruct the cooks as to the ratio of scallops and fish required to make the most authentic Fullmoon Egg.",
                "Zhongli has expertise in all manner of things: from fashion to daily necessities, wine and snacks, teas and spices, flora and fauna, and he will even actively debate affairs of trade, state, and international relations.",
                "But he only ever fills you in on some useless trivia, because he enjoys sharing such interesting things with you."

                "When making a purchase, look to slash prices.",
                "This is common knowledge among the people of Liyue. No matter what high heavens the store owner praises their product to, no matter its ancient history or classical value, prices are always flexible. Half the stated cost is a good place to start.",
                "But when Zhongli pays up (or rather, calls for someone else to pay up on his behalf,) he never looks at the price tag. As long as it catches his eye, Zhongli will pay as much as the owner asks.",
                "Indeed, he will even buy it at a premium sometimes.",
                "But for some reason, Zhongli always forgets to bring money.",

                "To those merchants who secretly pride themselves on their powers of flattery, Zhongli is a man of strange proclivities: in truth, he knows a great deal about the value of money and finance, and he also understands the suffering of the people.",
                "However, he seems to not understand that poverty is part of the human condition.",
                "Or perhaps it might be said that he cannot imagine himself being poor.",

                "He is **Morax**, the overlord Rex Lapis who rules Liyue, and the **Geo** Archon of the **The Seven|Seven Archons**. The very money that circulates throughout **Teyvat**, **Mora**, is named after him.",
                "When night falls, and bustling Liyue begins to slumber, he will sometimes stand atop the towering mountains and gaze upon this city, which he made with his own hands.",

                "When he laid down Liyue's laws by his divine might, he was the God of Contracts. When he minted the first Mora and made Liyue strong by dint of commerce, the merchants revered him as the God of Commerce.",
                "He has lived through countless years and is the eldest of the Seven, and so historian call him the God of History.",
                "Thousands of years ago, the forbears of the citizens of **Liyue Harbor** struck stones together to start fires and used piled stones to create stove. These blessings derived from the Geo element led the Geo Archon to gain the title of God of the Stove.",
                "People from other lands tend to call him Morax, though the people of Liyue prefer to use the term Rex Lapis.",
                "But in the hearts of lovers of opera and children, Morax's on-stage aspect, the all-conquering defender of Liyue &mdash; the Warrior God &mdash; is the most fascinating.",

                "Many stories and tales of Liyue are, when studied closely, stories of people visited by their deity at some point &mdash; and the citizens of Liyue are most proud indeed of that history."

                "To merchants, \"contracts\" are the most important standard that they hold themselves: deadlines, invoices, shipping destinations... Only a refined and strict order can sustain vibrant commerce, which is itself the lifeblood of Liyue Harbor.",
                "Thus the **Liyue Qixing|Qixing** punish violators of such laws unceasingly, not only to uphold the divine rulings of Morax but also to allow Liyue to maintain its vitality.",
                "Through the millennia, every generation of the Liyue Qixing commits to interpreting the law, including subtle amendments to plug loopholes found in the law. Any loopholes that remain undiscovered are seen by the merchants as \"permissible if unaddressed,\" and they make killings off such holes until they are discovered and patched up by the Liyue Qixing.",
                "Amid this game of cat-and-mouse, the book that collates such amendments has reached a whopping 279 pages thick.",
                "The person currently responsible for maintaining this book, the Tianquan **Ningguang**, is secretly (and humorously) referred to as the \"Tailor of Liyue,\" in honor of her speed in patching these laws up, and for her sharpness of eye.",
                "But no matter how complicated or tangled mortal laws become, one of these stands above all others in the eyes of Rex Lapis.",

                "Rex Lapis, most ancient of The Seven, has lived far too long. Rex Lapis still remembers that moment when the final archon took their divine seat, thus ending the Archon War and the era of warring gods. The Seven were a diverse lot and dispersed far and wide, but they all shouldered the burden of guiding humanity.",
                "As time passed, many of The Seven's titles changed hands, and only two remain of the first Seven: Rex Lapis and the Anemo Archon.",
                "The carefree **Barbatos**, the Anemo Archon, is the second eldest of The Seven.",

                "From then on, the first Seven would often gather in Liyue. Rex Lapis still remembers how those wines tasted.",
                "The world has changed much since then, and all that was once familiar has faded into memory. The seven seats changed and again were changed, till five of the seven at the table were all departed.",

                "One such type of creature caused no end of woe for the Geo Archon, long before he took that title along with his place among The Seven.",
                "These foul creatures, straight from the murky depth of the ocean abyss, had a squishy exterior, and possessed agile tentacles that would live on even after being cut off, even secreting some thick and revolting fluid in the process.",
                "This alone would have been enough to make them the most monstrous of all creatures, and still it was not the pinnacle of their monstrosity.",
                "What made them so truly terrible was their small size, which gave them the ability to duck into unimaginably small nooks and crannies.",

                "At the behest of the people of Liyue, Morax agreed to wipe these creatures out. But these parasites upon civilization could not be destroyed like enemies on a battlefield, by simply summoning a storm of stone spears that would shatter the earth and churn the soil....",
