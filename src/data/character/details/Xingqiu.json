                "To most people, Xingqiu appears to be a polite young man who takes his studies seriously, but he also has a more mischievous side to him. In the presence of close friends and family, he is gregarious and chatty, but shows more restraint than his elder brother. He is known to be somewhat messy, as his elder brother and the maids the family had hired have noted his room to be disorganized, while his writing is barely legible to most readers. Unlike his older sibling, who is devoted to the guild's success, Xingqiu is more reluctant to do so, putting him at odds with his family.\n",
                "He is good friends with Hu Tao and Chongyun, though he pranks the latter consistently. He is an avid reader and spends most of his time looking for rare books at Wanwen Bookhouse when he is not preoccupied with his duties, writing his own books from time to time, with \"A Legend of Sword\" being one of his books. While it did not garner the popularity he wished for in Liyue, he is unexpectedly popular in Inazuma and Fontaine after an Inazuman merchant took the book back home with them; however, Xingqiu was initially unaware of its popularity in Inazuma.\n",
                "Being the second son of the Feiyun Commerce Guild, Xingqiu is extremely wealthy and possesses a significant amount of influence, albeit he only resorts to using the guild as backup if the situation cannot be handled otherwise. Wishing to become a real life embodiment of the heroes he reads in stories, Xingqiu has a strong sense of justice and was able to revitalize the Guhua Clan despite being one of its younger members. He despises those who resort to underhanded methods or badmouths chivalrous heroes. Despite his apparently carefree personality, he is also intelligent, capable of rectifying the problem in his own unique way and has done so in a manner that people simply give up arguing against him if he gets himself in trouble. He claims that when his older brother takes over, he would have to do all the work for him; likewise, Yanfei has a positive view on him, as she was impressed by how he was able to keep up with her train of thought compared to the rest of his family.\n",
                "He enjoys baked goods and Yue-style food. He despises carrots as a result of his mother mashing them up into something unknown, as he cuts himself off before explaining what it ended up as, claiming that thinking of it makes him sick.\n"

        "appearance": [
            "Xingqiu has dark, navy blue hair with asymmetrical bangs and golden amber eyes. He has a slight frame and a light skin tone. He typically wears a blue earring with a gold tassel on his right ear. He is the only character who wears a single right earring. Other characters either have two earrings, a single left earring, or none at all. His vision is pinned to the bottom of the left side of his coat on top of a span of frilled, white fabric. A tassel made of amber which matches his eyes hangs from the vision.\n",
            "His attire consists of a long coat of silk which gradients from black at the collar, to shades of navy blue as the material descends. The coat's underside is a contrasting yellow with a faint, wavy pattern decorating the fabric, alluding to his Hydro vision. His collar and shoulder plates are rimmed with a gold, metallic material and to the right side of his chest sits a large circular brooch. It's embedded with a blue jewel, alike the center of his collar, coat buttons and sleeve cuffs (front and side). Underneath, Xingqiu wears a white long-sleeved shirt with a frilled seam to the right, revealed by the slit of his coat behind two overlapping ribbon-like buttons.\n",
            "He additionally wields distinct, frilled sleeves which extend from his coat's baggy, gold pair. A clover-like ribbon of white, black and yellow is pinned to the right side of his belt.Beneath this hangs a pair of rectangular ribbons, one in white covering a notably longer, black ribbon. Both of them wield gold decals at their ends. He also wears a pair of navy-blue shorts with ends of black that are mostly concealed by the length of his coat. On his right leg, Xingqiu wears a garter with a blue tassel, just below the knee. His footwear consists of a pair of white high-calf boots, black at the heels and soles with gold motifs. His outfit, Azure Silk, is described as fine robes woven from the high-quality silk sold by the Feiyun Commerce Guild.\n"

                "As the second-born son of the family, Xingqiu is not required to shoulder the burden of managing the Guild's affairs. However, Xingqiu possesses a unique scholarly talent among his peers &mdash; that is, the offspring of Liyue's wealthiest merchants &mdash; and was often praised by his tutors as a young student.",
                "Xingqiu's elder brother, while he was learning the family business from their father, firmly believed that Xingqiu would become a great asset to the business one day.",
                "However, little did he know that Xingqiu, after finishing the dauntingly thick volumes on commerce and philosophy, would hollow them out and sneak martial art novels into them, which he read incessantly thereafter.",

                "Sometimes, it means that he is off to fight for justice in the name of chivalry.",
                "Defeating bandits on the road, driving away monsters, helping distressed children by fetching their kites from the tree tops... there are all manner of responsibilities that fall into the category of chivalry.",
                "Inspired by tropes from his beloved martial arts novels &mdash; such as the king who wears a disguise and mingles with the common folk &mdash; Xingqiu does not hesitate to leverage the power of the Feiyun Commerce Guild to resolve more complex issues when violence isn't the answer."

            "Story 2": [
                "One day, Xingqiu's older brother came looking for him, only to find he wasn't around. When Xingqiu later returned, he came across his brother in the hallway.",
                "\"Your room was a mess, so I cleaned it up. Listen, both you and I are responsible for the reputation of Feiyun Commerce Guild. We have to act the part. If you can't clean up a room, how will you clean up the world? An adeptus once said...\"",
                "After half an hour of lecturing, Xingqiu was finally let go, but his brother said something strange at the end:",

                "Afterwards, even Xingqiu found it odd. Expecting that one of the maids would have something to say about the stash of martial arts novels under his bed, he had long since prepared his response, but in the end, no one ever bothered to check his room again."
            ],
            "Story 3": [
                "To keep Xingqiu from spending his whole day at Wanwen Bookhouse at Feiyun Slope, his father agreed to let him learn martial arts from the Guhua clan.",

There was no proper tuition and it turned out the luxury dojo he had signed up in didn't even belong to the clan &mdash; they had just rented it temporarily to keep up appearances.",
                "Xingqiu's father was, of course aware of this state of affairs in advance. To him, the whole thing was just for fun; he thought Xingqiu would be content to learn a spot of bladework for show, not for serious self-defense.",
                "He hadn't counted on the prodigiously intelligent and extremely well-read Xingqiu being as outstanding a talent in Guhua as he was in every other discipline he had turned his hand to. A combination of his own intuition and extensive knowledge of ancient literature meant he was able to completely revitalize the dead art.",
                "Xingqiu was disappointed by Guhua's martial arts program at the beginning, but he found the other tricks they taught be exactly what he hoped for. Quicklime, smoking sand, paper fish, sword-swallowing, fire-breathing... Xingqiu was spoilt for choice.",
                "He decided on the spot that he would learn them all, no matter how long it will take him. He reasoned that they would be useful to have repertoire during his future exploits as a chivalrous hero."

It is said that the Clan harbored three great secret arts &mdash; the ways of the \"Light Piercer\" for polearms, \"Rain Cutter\" for swords, and \"Life Ender\" for those who excelled in both. The three arts would be refined over the generations, and with time would reach their apex. Yet the Clan's strength would continue to wane, leading to them losing their influence... The three arts became diamonds in the rough, quietly awaiting a successor.",

But the way Xingqiu saw it, the basis of the polearm and sword was the use of a Vision. Martial arts were meant to see a Vision as an extension of themselves, and see their weapon as an extension of the Vision. Hence, he says that: the arts of both the polearm and the sword are just the art of the \"eye.\"",
                "Having come to this epiphany, Xingqiu took up a quill and penned a verse on the Martial Principle. Reading it, the Guhua head was shaken with tears, declaring that \"it is not Xingqiu who needs the Guhua Clan, but the Guhua Clan that needs Xingqiu.\" Since then, this verse has been sealed up at the Clan headquarters at Wangshan Hall. Disciples are proscribed from reading it, much less outsiders.",
