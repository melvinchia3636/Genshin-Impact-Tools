            "content": "Tartaglia, also known by his alias \" Childe \", is a playable Hydro  character in Genshin Impact. He is the most recent, the Eleventh, of the Eleven Harbingers of the Fatui. Following danger wherever he goes, Childe is always eager for a challenge, making him extremely dangerous despite being the youngest member."

            "content": [
                "Tartaglia describes himself as \"kind of a bad guy\", living for the thrill of a fight and causing chaos.\n",
                "As a child, Tartaglia was frightened and hesitant, but he secretly desired to become an adventurer like the ones his father told him about as they fished together. After falling into The Abyss and meeting and training with Skirk, Tartaglia's personality drastically changed.\n",
                "Although he appears to relatively friendly on the surface, Tartaglia is a bloodthirsty warrior. The Abyss and his old master, Skirk, made him self-confident, solipsistic, and brash, thriving on the sensation of being alive. A warrior at heart, he constantly seeks ways to grow stronger, regardless of how he obtains said power. Tartaglia considers those who wish to become strong like him to be friends and takes pleasure in battling them on the battlefield. He lusts for combat and grows excited by fighting strong opponents, even if it could mean dying in the process. He uses bows because he is weakest with them, making his victories with them all the more exhilarating.\n",
                "Because of his pride, Tartaglia is exceptionally reliable at accomplishing the tasks given to him, no matter how difficult they may be or if they go against his values. This, combined with his straightforward nature, makes him rather easy to manipulate. Despite disliking how his plan in Liyue Harbor could potentially harm innocents, he puts it into motion to fulfill his mission in Liyue \u2014 only to learn he was meant to fail as part of an even larger plan he was not privy to, much to his consternation.\n",
                "Amongst the rest of the Harbingers, Tartaglia is considered an oddball. While his fellow Harbingers prefer clandestine operations and staying behind the scenes, Tartaglia favors being front and center. On top of his lust for battle and tendency to cause havoc, he is a public figure known for attending social gatherings and even participates as an actor in plays and theater. As a result, Childe's coworkers are wary of him, while he holds them in disdain for their schemes and \"intangible\" methods. While he is quite capable of scheming, he only resorts to such approaches when necessary due to his straightforward nature. He also appears to treat his subordinates less harshly than the rest of the Harbingers, stating that he doesn't use lethal force against the recruits in his care, nor does he threaten any of them.\n",
                "Tartaglia dedicates himself to those he cares about wholeheartedly. He is unquestionably loyal to the Tsaritsa and holds her in high esteem, seeing himself as her weapon of war. He also cares deeply for his family; he sends money, gifts, and letters home often. Tartaglia is exceptionally proud of his three younger siblings and dotes on them frequently, especially his youngest brother Teucer \u2014 he is willing to lie and even put himself in mortal danger, so as long as it makes him happy.  While this is callous, Tartaglia prioritizes his brother's safety over his own. He sees the Traveler as a friend, and enjoys sparring with them. Despite Zhongli deceiving him (and often using him as financial support), he remains on good terms with the former Archon.\n",
                "Tartaglia enjoys fishing, having grown to appreciate fishing with his father before his drastic change. He uses it as a way to meditate, honing his endurance and contemplating his combat techniques. He has no particular preference for meals, declaring that all food is delicious, stating that a true warrior shouldn't fuss over what they eat in a manner similar to the weapon they use.\n"

        "appearance": [
            "Tartaglia is a tall young man with short, choppy orange hair and dull blue eyes. He wears a red Fatui mask pulled off to one side of his head. He also wears a beaded earring with a red crystal on his left ear. A few lighter blonde streaks can be seen in his hair, with one prominent one on the left side of his bangs.\n",
            "He wears a grey jacket with dark red and light grey details, grey pants, and black boots and gloves. His jacket is left unbuttoned at the end to reveal a belt, which his Hydro Vision is attached to. It is instead held by buttons, with the outer edge decorated by a black symbol. He wears short gloves that expose his wrists. He also wears a red banner that goes across his chest and over his left shoulder, which becomes infused with a wispy Hydro effect when in the melee stance of his Elemental Skill Foul Legacy: Raging Tide. His outfit, Blades of Glory is described to be  illustrious attire that signifies Childe's position as the eleventh Fatui Harbinger.\n",
            "During the Golden House battle, Tartaglia wears his Electro Delusion to the right of his Vision in the center of his belt, and then moves his Vision to the empty slot on his right chest when fully activating the Foul Legacy Transformation.\n"

                "Despite holding one of the most senior positions in the **Fatui** as one of the **Eleven Fatui Harbingers|Eleven Harbingers**, Childe very much looks like the young adult that he still is.",
                "He is a wolf in sheep's clothing, however, for under the cheerful and confident appearance lies a deadly swordsman.",
                "He is the youngest among the Harbingers, but one of the most dangerous among their number. That said, Childe doesn't seem to fit in well with the others.",
                "As a fighter first and foremost, he is quite at odds with this organization of deceit and treachery."
            ],
            "Story 1": [
                "As the youngest Harbinger in the history of the Fatui, Childe is hardly bound by convention, and plays by his own rules accordingly.",
                "Though this lone wolf is not so well received by his peers and is also at odds with their methods, his cavalier demeanor hides a responsible, watertight meticulousness.",
                "He is a proud man of his word. Even if the promise he makes is absurd, he will never break it. Be it exterminating all the dragons inside their lairs, venturing into a domain of extreme danger, or single-handedly overthrowing the territory of a nobleman...",
                "He not only keeps his promises, but also does so with finesse and surgical precision..<!--in-game typo--> As the Harbingers' vanguard, Childe always appears in the vulnerable underbellies of **Snezhnaya**'s enemy states, striking as a conflict is about to erupt."
            ],
            "Story 2": [
                "Many myths in Snezhnaya say that Tartaglia has been on the battlefield since he was 14 years old.",
                "Oddly enough, at that young age he already seemed to be a skilled slaughterer with mastery of many forms of martial arts.",
                "But more terrifying than his skill in combat was his passion for it. Perilous battles would only excite him, and terrifying foes would exhilarate him all the more.",
                "Childe's arrogance and conceit are derived from honing himself across countless battles, and from unmatched combat experience.",
                "On the other hand, because they fret about the way his quarrelsome personality tends to invite unwanted trouble, the other Harbingers constantly try to get him sent on missions to places as far from Snezhnaya as possible, so that they can avoid the fallout.",
                "The man is incomprehensibly ever in the eye of the storm, and these unusual experiences have also made him quite the show-off who revels in the praise of others.",
                "Unlike other members of the Harbingers, who prefer to keep a low profile, Tartaglia will often go to watch public performances &mdash; occasionally even becoming part of the show himself."
            ],
            "Story 3": [
                "Ice fishing has been one of Tartaglia's hobbies since childhood.",
                "In those days, he was known neither by the names Tartaglia nor \"Childe,\" as the Fatui call him, but as Ajax, named by his father after some hero's tale. He and his father would cut holes open upon frozen lakes, before sitting beside them and tend to their fishing lines.",
                "This was no easy task, and would sometimes take the entire morning.",
                "But whether it was chiseling away at the thick ice or the long waits in between catches, he was always accompanied by his father's unending tales of adventure.",
                "These were stories of his father's adventures from when he was young, and they became the future that Tartaglia secretly envisioned for himself.",
                "So he would pay close attention, putting himself into the shoes of the protagonist of those tales, immersing himself fully in them even as they waited for a fish to bite.",
                "Even after leaving home, Ajax, later to be known as \"Childe\" Tartaglia, would keep up that hobby of his.",
                "No longer accompanied by the stories of bygone days, fishing instead became an opportunity to train &mdash; to hone his endurance, and reflect on combat techniques.",
                "Such long periods of meditation to refine his skills swiftly relegated the question of a successful catch to irrelevance."
            ],
            "Story 4": [
                "Unlike what the rest of the world may think, Tartaglia was not born with his exceptional skills in battle.",
                "But he would never speak to everyone about that critical fateful encounter of his...",
                "When he was 14, he fled his monotonous life at home with nothing but a shortsword and a bag of bread in hand.",
                "That 14-year-old boy got lost in the snowy forest.",
                "Pursued by bears and wolf packs, he lost his footing and fell into a bottomless crack in the earth's surface.",
                "There, he witnessed the endless possibilities of another ancient world. There, he would meet a mysterious swordswoman...",
                "Or perhaps one should say that this dark realm had sensed the burning ambition in this boy's heart.",
                "This darkness was something that the Harbinger Childe could never again delve into.",
                "In those three months, the swordswoman taught Tartaglia how to pass through the Abyss unhindered, and more importantly, nurtured the ability to stir up endless havoc from within Ajax's trouble-mongering nature.",
                "No one knew what happened within that darkness during those three months, nor would Ajax ever speak of this to anyone. When his worried mother and sisters finally found him in that forest, only 3 days had passed in this world.",
                "Thus did Ajax's first adventure end, with his now-rusty shortsword in hand.",
                "This would mark the end of his youth and the beginning of his days as a warrior."

                "By the time he returned home, the young man was no longer the same.",
                "He was no longer frightened and hesitant but had become frivolous and confident. He acted as if this world revolved around him, and as if battle existed for his sake.",
                "Conflict often brings about change, and this capricious, incalculable change attracted Ajax like a revolving kaleidoscope.",
                "In the eyes of his father, that third son that he had so worried about had changed for the worse, bringing much havoc uncalled-for to the seaside village of **Morepesok**.",
                "Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that Ajax had become a nexus of strife, for no matter where he went, fights and squabbles would follow &mdash; and he reveled in it.",
                "Ultimately, after a huge brawl was pacified with some difficulty and with some near-fatal misses, his father had no choice but to hand his beloved son over for conscription into the Fatui.",
                "He hoped that the strict military training of the Fatui could hone his son's temper, but wound up watching fully-armed troops getting the stuffing beaten out of them by a mere child.",
                "This was a great disappointment to his father, but it also caught the attention of **Pulcinella**, the 5th Harbinger.",
                "Shocked by Ajax's great strength, and curious about how he had invariably became the eye of a vortex of discord, Pulcinella inducted Ajax into the Fatui under the pretext of meting out punishment, ordering him to start from the bottom and take up the duty of serving the **Tsaritsa**.",
                "His insatiable desire for conquest would thus be constantly satiated in fighting for the Fatui, and his ever-burgeoning ego would gorge upon the elation of vanquishing mighty foes...",
                "Until at last, Ajax was chosen to be one of the Fatui Harbingers, donning the mantle of \"Childe\" Tartaglia and becoming one of the most powerful people in Snezhnaya.",
                "But becoming Tartaglia was far from his end goal. To someone who sought to conquer the world, this was but a tiny step in his journey."

                "Do not fret for my sake, Tonia, and refrain from making trouble for anyone at home. I will be home soon. When I have seized the seven stars of Liyue and laid them at the feet of Her Majesty the Tsaritsa, I will take the first ship home, just as I promised &mdash; and you know how I always keep my promises.",

                "It was his reward for slaying many terrible beasts, and a memento of countless battles. But it was not this that brought Tartaglia joy, for honor is the natural reward of the warrior. Nor did he pay any mind to the odd looks his new \"colleagues\" gave him, for the opinions and bellyaches of others meant nothing to him.",
                "The sight of the Tsaritsa on her lofty throne alone stirred the young man's heart with respect and admiration, not merely because she opened the way for him to find an abundance of looming battles, but also because of the way she looked upon him. Her gaze was cold but pure, arrogant yet sharp.",
                "She was not only the sacrosanct Cryo **Archon** but a true warrior also.",
