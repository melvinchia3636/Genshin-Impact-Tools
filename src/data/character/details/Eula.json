As a young child, she was forced by her family to learn noble etiquette as part of an educational regime so harsh that it is considered borderline abusive. Although Eula considers most of her clan's customs despicable, she personally enjoys the traditional \"Dance of Sacrifice\" and incorporates it into her style of \"Favonius Bladework.\" She has a strained relationship with her family, who denounce her as a traitor for leaving the clan. She has stated that she would not hesitate to destroy her own family if they endangered Mondstadt, even finding it fitting. While she still tends to act like a clan noble on the outside, inside she is actually a kind-hearted person, echoed by both Amber and Sara.\n",
