            "content": "Kaeya Alberich is a playable Cryo  character in Genshin Impact. Kaeya is the Cavalry Captain of the Knights of Favonius. He is held in high regard by the people of Mondstadt \u2014 even with all his eccentricities and secrets. He is obtained in the Prologue, Act I: The Outlander Who Caught the Wind during the quest Crash Course."

            "content": [
                "Kaeya is an outwardly confident and charming individual with a flair for drama. He is sometimes seen as overly laid-back and even lazy, but he takes his work seriously. He is surprisingly popular among the elderly of Mondstadt, even earning himself the title of \"top candidate for grandson-in-law.\" His charisma and determination have earned him the admiration, respect, and favor of many people in Mondstadt \u2014 yet, his love for provoking others has also gained him the exasperation of those same people.\n",
                "He seems to get a kick out of telling bald-faced lies and convincing others to do his work, but this serves him well in his role in the Knights of Favonius. He is a self-proclaimed \"anti-hero with an attitude problem\"; as long as everything ends the way he wants, Kaeya doesn't care about the methods used. Still, according to his informant Vile, he draws the line at working with those who threaten other people's families, believing they deserve to be \"hunted down and destroyed.\"\n",
                "Kaeya enjoys putting people into high-stress situations and challenging their values, which he does to both his enemies and his allies alike. He takes pleasure in seeing the hesitation in his comrades' eyes at the moment just before they dive into battle with him, just as he takes pleasure in the look of fear in his enemies' eyes as they face off against him.\n",
                "Despite his extroversion, the Traveler has observed that he appears to struggle with loneliness, though he playfully deflects when confronted about it. He frequently reminds the Traveler that they can talk to him, invites them to spend time with him, insistently offers (sometimes extensive) assistance, and often voices his disappointment whenever the Traveler has to leave, showing his desire to be helpful and aversion to being alone.\n",
                "He appreciates the taste of alcohol and is often seen drinking when he isn't busy. He despises grape juice, claiming that the people who drink it have no patience and are missing out, though he understands that not everyone can drink alcohol until they come of age. The Traveler thinks his drinking habit may be some kind of coping mechanism, and Rosaria implies that Kaeya's fa\u00e7ades start to slip when he's intoxicated. \n"
            ]
        },
        "appearance": [
            "Kaeya is a tall young man with a lean build and a tanned complexion. His visible eye is sharp and slanted, periwinkle with long eyelashes and the same diamond-shaped pupil as Dainsleif. He has navy-blue hair with streaks of lighter blue, accompanied by a long lock of hair that rests over his left shoulder, cascading down to his waist. His bangs are trimmed in a lengthy fringe that covers the right side of his face and almost hides a plain black eyepatch, which he claims to have inherited from his grandfather, a pirate. However, this was later revealed to be a lie he told to mess with people.\n",
            "Kaeya's clothes are fitting for a Cavalry Captain, albeit a flamboyant one. He wears a white-collared, cleavage-revealing blouse with forearm-length sleeves that have dark blue folded cuffs. Above that, he wears a light blue vest or jacket, and a cape adorned with a fur collar. He wears dark, tight-fitted trousers and knee-length boots. For accessories, he wears fingerless gloves with spikes on the wrists and marked with the same diamond shape as his eyes. He also wears a loose brown belt from which his Vision hangs, as well as a rope which may be meant for a scabbard to carry his sword. He has a single earring on his left ear, which has some kind of blue gem on a metal frame shaped like a teardrop with a spike at the bottom. The same gems are found hanging off of two straps at his ankles. His outfit has many more small details, such as a blue band around his forearms to keep his cuffs folded, a chain across his chest that seems to be attached to the ends of his collars, and unexplained straps, belts, or bands. His outfit, Icy Featherflight, is described to be fashionable and adorned with a fur collar.\n",
            "Notably, while other Mondstadt characters' Visions feature three feathers per wing, Kaeya's Vision only features two feathers. He is also the only one with a wing on the right side of the back of his Vision (other Mondstadt Visions have those on the left side or no wings at all on the back).\n"

                "Not so unlike Death After Noon's wild and explosive taste, one might add.",
                "However, his reckless approach to things is not uncontroversial. Once, in order to force a bandit leader into facing him directly, Kaeya triggered the **Ruin Guard** at an ancient ruin to cut his opponent off, putting his own men at risk in the process.",
                "It's times like these when even Jean, who puts a lot of trust in Kaeya, finds herself shaking her head in disapproval.",

They were almost like twins, knowing each other's thoughts and intentions without a word, protecting Mondstadt in both light and dark.",
                "...Until that fateful day, now ingrained deep in Kaeya's memory, when the convoy that Diluc was escorting was attacked by a **Ursa the Drake|huge monster**.",

                "There was a side to Kaeya that he kept hidden from the world: In truth, he was an agent of **Khaenri'ah**, placed in Mondstadt to serve their interests. His father had abandoned him in this strange and unknown land to fulfill his mission, and it was Master Crepus and the city of Mondstadt that had welcomed him with open arms when they found him.",

                "But now, Crepus' death upset this delicate balance. He felt liberated, but also ashamed of how selfishly he was responding.",
                "As an adopted son, he should have saved Crepus, but he had arrived moments too late. As a brother, he should have shared in Diluc's grief, and yet as their father lay dying on the ground he had hung back behind his brother, that ancient plot running through his mind.",
                "Consumed by guilt, Kaeya knocked on Diluc's door. As the rain poured down, the shroud of secrecy was washed away, all lies were revealed. Kaeya had finally come clean.",

                "The brothers drew their blades, this time pointing them at each other. Kaeya felt that this was his punishment for a lifetime of lies. But as the two crossed blades, Kaeya was overcome by the sensation of great elemental power surging through him. For years, he had stayed out of the way in his brother's shadow. But now, for the first time ever, he was facing his brother as his true self.",
                "Bitterly cold and brittle elemental energy burst forth from the tip of his sword to meet Diluc's searing flames head-on. The clash of crimson fire and azure ice created a sudden swirl of wind that stunned them both. This was the grim moment at which Kaeya's Vision appeared.",
                "Since that day, Kaeya and Diluc have gone their separate ways. But he never discusses it, just as he never discusses the origin of his Vision.",
                "Though it is a reminder of the hard-fought battle, and the prize that he earned in exchange for revealing the unadulterated truth, Kaeya sees it as a stern reminder that he must live the rest of his life under the heavy burden of lies."
