She combines her astrology skills with hydromancy, which makes her a well-known, if still growing astrologist. In part due to her astrology, Mona can tell whether or not a person is lying, can sense their intentions from a single glance, being capable of seeing their fate and is able to accurately deduce a person's traits just from knowing what their constellation is.\n",
                "Being obsessed with astrology gives Mona a sense of pride, but this also serves as a double-edged sword; any Mora she gets her hands on is immediately spent on astrology-related materials, regardless of its cost. She only realizes too late when she has run out of Mora to meet her daily needs, occasionally going without shelter or food for days on end. She is particularly picky when it comes to eating, as she prefers simple dishes when eating out; when she cooks, she makes the most out of whatever she can buy. She does not tolerate those who disrespect her. She also makes a lot of denials when someone is pointing out what she doesn't have.\n"
