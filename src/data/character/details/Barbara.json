                "Barbara is a hard-worker, but can be hard on herself at times. However successful she may seem to others, she shares her own mixed feelings on her achievements. Barbara will become somewhat disillusioned and doubtful when pondering about how long a smile lasts on someone's face after listening to her song. Her craving for recognition switched over into the mere desire to help people. Even with all her depressing thoughts, she quickly jumps back on her feet, not allowing herself to be depressed for more than 30 seconds. Barbara continues to strive for excellence, believing she'll be of help to her sister.\n",
                "Barbara feels slightly inferior to Jean as she feels that her accomplishments are nowhere near as significant as her sister's and hopes to surpass her in at least one activity. While she likes to call Jean \"big sister\" and unconditionally loves her, Barbara usually keeps these feelings suppressed while on duty.\n",
                "Being the deaconess for the Church, Barbara takes the safekeeping of religious artifacts seriously and worships Barbatos. After seeing the damaged Holy Lyre der Himmel, she flew into a panic, and refused to let anyone see it after the Stormterror incident. She also appears to be oblivious to the fact that Venti is actually her god, Barbatos.\n",
                "Despite her appearance and personality, Barbara loves spicy food and drinks as it keeps her awake and working to the best of her abilities. She dislikes bitter foods.\n"

Her white tights have a faint flower polka-dot pattern. Her Vision is attached to a gold-adorned spell-book with a light blue cover and a small cross charm hangs at her side, attached to a black strap held together with a gold hoop. Her outfit, Innocent Longing, is described to be a Deaconess's uniform from the Church of Favonius with a unique Barbara streak running through it. Her summer outfit, Summertime Sparkle, is described to be a pretty skirt that brims with summer vitality and carries with it a cool ocean breeze.\n"

                "The story of how Barbara obtained her **Vision** is hardly the typical tale of high-stakes heroism.",
                "She had just joined the church and was looking after a little boy with a high and persisting fever. Nothing Barbara could think of would console the boy and bring an end to his relentless tears.",
                "Someone remarked that while the boy had already taken his medicine, there was no way to cure the pain of missing one's family. Another suggested that Barbara sing a song for the boy to raise his spirits.",
                "Barbara had never sung a song in her life up until this point, but how could she shy away from it in a moment like this?",
                "\"Never having sung before is no reason to abandon a child in their time of need,\" Barbara thought to herself.",
                "And so, Barbara took the boy in her arms and sang him a song: a lullaby, the only song she knew. It was unceremonious beginning to her singing career.",
                "After quickly realizing that she barely knew any of the words, she had to resort to humming the tune instead. Nevertheless, her voice began to soothe the child, and so she kept singing. She sang the same song, over and over again, until her throat was dry and her voice was hoarse.",
                "Finally, the boy fell asleep. Exhausted, Barbara lay down by the wall and fell straight asleep herself.",
                "Early the next morning, Barbara awoke to discover the boy's fever had come down.",
                "Perhaps it was because she had sung for him, or perhaps it had something to do with the Vision which had mysteriously appeared next to her hand at some point during the night. Barbara was not preoccupied with the Vision, however. It was the sight of the boy smiling once again that filled her heart with joy.",
                "Barbara received her Vision for the simple but beautiful wish that took hold in her heart that night: A dream of healing the sick through the power of song."
