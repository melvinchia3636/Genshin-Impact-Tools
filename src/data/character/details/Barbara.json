                "Barbara is a hard-worker, but can be hard on herself at times. However successful she may seem to others, she shares her own mixed feelings on her achievements. Barbara will become somewhat disillusioned and doubtful when pondering about how long a smile lasts on someone's face after listening to her song. Her craving for recognition switched over into the mere desire to help people. Even with all her depressing thoughts, she quickly jumps back on her feet, not allowing herself to be depressed for more than 30 seconds. Barbara continues to strive for excellence, believing she'll be of help to her sister.\n",
                "Barbara feels slightly inferior to Jean as she feels that her accomplishments are nowhere near as significant as her sister's and hopes to surpass her in at least one activity. While she likes to call Jean \"big sister\" and unconditionally loves her, Barbara usually keeps these feelings suppressed while on duty.\n",
                "Being the deaconess for the Church, Barbara takes the safekeeping of religious artifacts seriously and worships Barbatos. After seeing the damaged Holy Lyre der Himmel, she flew into a panic, and refused to let anyone see it after the Stormterror incident. She also appears to be oblivious to the fact that Venti is actually her god, Barbatos.\n",

Her white tights have a faint flower polka-dot pattern. Her Vision is attached to a gold-adorned spell-book with a light blue cover and a small cross charm hangs at her side, attached to a black strap held together with a gold hoop. Her outfit, Innocent Longing, is described to be a Deaconess's uniform from the Church of Favonius with a unique Barbara streak running through it. Her summer outfit, Summertime Sparkle, is described to be a pretty skirt that brims with summer vitality and carries with it a cool ocean breeze.\n"
