            "content": [
                "The Raiden Shogun is a firm believer of what she believes to be eternity\u2014a place in which everything is kept the same, regardless of what goes on. She is honorable in her conduct and is revered by the people of Inazuma.\n",
                "The Raiden Shogun exists in two forms\u2014Raiden Ei, her true identity, and the Shogun, a puppet created by Ei to act as the ruler of Inazuma in her stead while she meditates in the Plane of Euthymia. This puppet follows a set of directives programmed into her, which are extremely hard to modify even by Ei herself. The Shogun is cold and stern in personality, even callous at times; she is limited in emotional expression, has no likes and dislikes, and has no need for recreation. The Shogun thinks of herself as Ei's assistant, and does exactly as she wishes, no more and no less; she cannot act without Ei's direction, and if her usual functions are disabled, the Shogun becomes incapable of doing anything. Due to her limited protocols and Ei's indifference for anything other than her goal of eternity, the puppet can easily be manipulated by outside forces. For example, the Kujou Clan and the Fatui tricked her into initiating and maintaining the Vision Hunt Decree.\n",
                "While Ei has a more stern demeanor than the average person, she is notably more emotive and sociable than the Shogun. Unlike the Shogun, Ei has preferences, such as a love for sweets. Due to her dedication to eternity, Ei is wary of the idea of change. However, she shows curiosity rather than disdain when it comes to new things, such as the appearance of the Traveler and the customs of the modern world. Due to having lost many of her loved ones over the centuries, Ei is driven by a fear of further loss, wanting to preserve Inazuma for all eternity. To this end, she sealed herself in the Plane of Euthymia to keep herself from the effects of erosion, while she created the puppet Shogun to be immune to the decay of the physical body. While in the Plane of Euthymia, Ei was indifferent to anything that did not affect her pursuit of eternity and had a low opinion of human ambition due to ambition leading to loss and suffering, thus making it incompatible with eternity. Even in the Plane of Euthymia, however, she could not truly escape loneliness, as she was happy to see her friend Yae Miko again, and she appears to enjoy the Traveler and Paimon's company.\n",
                "Ei has a weakness against desserts and sweet things. Her view is that desserts can't pose any serious obstacle to her pursuit of Eternity to the extent that in any case of cavities, she could just replace her tooth. Yae Miko and Venti also mentioned about her fondness against desserts, with the Anemo Archon even suggesting that the Traveler bring her desserts to exploit the said vulnerability. During her story quest, when asked by Traveler, Ei explained that since humans enjoyed desserts, she should enjoy it as well. Ei also has an aversion to cooking, saying that she can do anything but that.\n",
                "In spite of her flawed actions, Ei truly loves Inazuma as her sister did and just wants to protect it and her subjects for all eternity. After she was convinced that her actions were wrong, Ei shows remorse on her prior conduct and is willing to change her ways in governing Inazuma so as to avoid repeating her past mistakes.\n"

            "The Raiden Shogun is an adult woman with long braided violet hair behind her back and a hairpin, which belonged to Beelzebul's twin sister, Raiden Makoto, on her right side. She wears a small crimson ribbon on her neck as a choker. Her kimono has an assortment of patterns in different shades of purple and crimson, along with a badge bearing the emblem of Inazuma tied to the front of her clothing below her right breast and a more elaborate emblem on a pauldron on her left shoulder. She wears dark purple thigh-high tights with small diamond openings at the top. On the back of her outfit, she wears a crimson bow with tassels. She also wears high-heeled sandals; the one on the right is adorned with two pale violet flowers.\n",
            "Unlike the other known Archons, she does not appear to wear a 'fake' vision, as none of the electro gems on her clothing appear in the shape of a typical Inazuman vision. Instead, all three of these emblems (one tied to her lower chest, another on the 'fan' on her back and another on her pauldron) all glow faintly when her elemental burst is charged, somewhat similar to how the Traveler's clothing glows.\n"

                "The previous Electro Archon, **Raiden Makoto**, was no great fighter, and the things Ei had charge over were mostly matters of warfare and slaughter. However, Ei also had moments of repose away from battle, sitting with her friends under the sakura trees and playing karuta.",
                "Due to her character, Ei was always the most wooden player. She was never the final victor, nor did she ever have a taste of the prizes that the **Kitsune Saiguu** reserved for the winners.",
                "Thus, she poured the effort that she put into swordsmanship into karuta practice, often pestering Makoto or **Mikoshi Chiyo** to karuta matches, or spending much time by moonlight reading the poetry inscribed on the cards out loud.",
                "At last, the day came that under the sakura trees, Ei would defeat opponent after opponent. Even the mighty **tengu** would be felled after a hard-fought battle, and thus was she crowned the champion.",
                "Ei let out a victorious whoop at her victory, only to be greeted by the sounds of her friends' laughter. Only then did she realize that she had lost her usual composure entirely, before snapping both arms back down and reverting to her usual cool facade.",
                "Of course, her friends did not intend to make sport of her. Indeed, they understood her character and the manner in which she had worked ever so hard to come out on top.",

                "\"I said it was a reward, yes, but it was simply some hand-made cakes of mine. I didn't think that you would be so concerned about it, Ei. Well then, enjoy the spoils of your victory to your heart's content.\"",
                "Ei was hardly one to be greedy for snacks. But as a samurai, she firmly believed that what she lost must be reclaimed. These pastries were more akin to a vindication of her desire to win.",
                "&mdash;But it was not long before that cool demeanor of hers broke into a smile again. The cakes were lovely &mdash; just like the taste of victory. As for her clumsy attempts to hide that smile, one could only say that it was an entertaining sight all around for her friends.",
                "To this day, Ei still often remembers that sakura tree.",

                "Then, Ei could only smile wryly, realizing that she, the kagemusha, was even more old-fashioned than the real Raiden Shogun. She thought to herself that she must learn to be more leisurely, just like Makoto.",
                "Yet the times changed all too quickly, all but catching Ei off guard. Before she knew it, her hands already held the blade that the dying Raiden Makoto had passed on to her.",

                "\"Do you presently have some new ideas, or have you, too, fallen victim to inexorable 'eroded'?\"",

                "Her heart was clear, and she would have remained in that state, but hearing the cries of her people, she had to command her feet to stop.",
                "The sky above the mirror was no longer empty, and all about the silent halls, she heard the cry of crows. Dawn was coming. The samurai must take up her sword.",

                "It was born from Raiden Makoto's divine might, but it was never once sharpened. It took after its owner, of course, for Makoto was not one for battle. It was but a symbol, a sign of true peace.",
                "The day Makoto passed on, it was given into Ei's hands. The sword was stained with blood, then, and as the blade drew its first taste of crimson, it was blown aside by wild winds and blazing thunder.",
                "Makoto gave it the name Musou Isshin, and desired to have it witness an Inazuma as lovely as a dream and the noble hearts that dwell in this world.",
                "Ei did not change its name. For she, too, had looked out over that vast scene of beauty, and a stronger that was purer and stronger still was birthed in her heart thereby. The aesthetic of lightning is precisely to capture that which is precious amidst fleeting transience."

                "And that was when she thought of someone: the cunning and clever **Yae Miko**. She was not precisely someone to be trusted, but she was in many ways also Ei's best choice.",
