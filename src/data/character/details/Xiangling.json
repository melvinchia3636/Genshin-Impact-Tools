She will use anything for her recipes, even unconventional ingredients that would gross out others. Even if some of the dishes are not to her liking, Xiangling will not give up and simply press on to modify or start over from scratch.\n",

She dislikes having to limit herself to a specific style of cooking, seeing it as bland and unsurprising.\n",
