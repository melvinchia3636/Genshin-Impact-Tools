                "He can sense the mood of the wind, smell a scent from miles away, and knows many practical applications for plants of all kinds. The one thing he can't bring to mind is the faces of his parents.",
                "What kind of people were they? No matter how hard he tries, he cannot remember.",
                "His memory starts after his life with the wolves had already begun. The wolves took him in as part of their \"lupical\" &mdash; a word he was taught by **Andrius|someone else**, which means family."

                "Eat as much as you can and drink plenty of water. Cool off in the lake when you're hot, and go find some juicy berries when you're thirsty.",

                "\"Master, what is... 'friends'?\" Razor once asked of his new mentor, working at the limits of his vocabulary. His purple-clothed mentor seemed to know it all, from how to make hash browns from potatoes in the ground, to the name of the brightest star in the summer night sky. However, **Lisa** simply smiled and yawned without answering him. Razor thought about it when the wind blew, when the rain fell &mdash; even when **Wolfhook** berries got stuck in his fur.  He just couldn't figure it out.",
                "Until one day, Razor met a bright-red, 'burny' girl. They stood in the wind together, got soaked in the rain together &mdash; she even rolled around in Wolfhook bushes with him. Her name was **Klee**. When Razor played with her, it was like being a wolf pup again.",

The broken-off hilt of a greatsword, a children's storybook called The Wolf and the **Windwheel Aster**, and a dry, withered four-leaf clover. Though he understands neither the intricacies of human relations nor the ways of the world, Razor knows that these are gifts from the ones known as 'friends' &mdash; and that is what makes them his most treasured possessions of all."

The wolf pack ran to his aid and put up a fearless fight, but every last one of them was defeated by the Abyss Mage. As he looked on helplessly at his dear companions being harmed, Razor let out an almighty roar like that of a cornered animal.",

He threw off his shackles and raised his weapon. The Abyss Mage was overwhelmed and defeated by wild, unfettered frenzy of Electro energy, but this time it was too late to save Razor's wolven companions.",
