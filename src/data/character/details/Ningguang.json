She makes use of a large intelligence network and \"pawns\" to gain the information she needs, and will only make use of people whose weaknesses she knows. As a result, she is disliked by those with significant influence, but nonetheless, many accept it as she adds to the overall prosperity of both the Qixing and Liyue Harbor itself.\n",

Under her decree in response to a case of water contamination, those who intentionally endanger public health and safety should be \"shown no mercy whatsoever.\" When Osial was reawakened and threatened Liyue Harbor, she put her conflict with the adepti aside and ultimately sacrificed the Jade Chamber, her life's work, to seal it away. She is also particularly fond of children, both because they give her vital intelligence and because she enjoys seeing them smile.\n"
