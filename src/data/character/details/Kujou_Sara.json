                "The Tenryou Commission is one arm of the Tri-Commission, and is in charge of the security of Inazuma. Today, Sara is a general of the Tenryou Commission, and hers is the vital task of maintaining order within Inazuma City itself.",
                "She governs well and is ever determined to set a good example for her subordinates. No matter how tough the issue, if it falls under the Tenryou Commission's jurisdiction, Sara can solve it in good time.",
                "Sara smiles little and is swift and resolute in the pursuit of her missions, and so many Inazumans consider her an inaccessible, stone-cold military person.",

                "However, this does not mean that Sara will stoop to any means necessary to enforce it.",
                "When citizens are inevitably affected as the decree is carried out, she will expend the utmost patience and sincerity to attempt to explain the Almighty Shogun's long-term goals.",
                "She has also given clear orders forbidding the harming or exploiting of civilians during the pursuit of the decree, as such evil deeds will only drag the great name of the Archon through the mud.",
                "Unfortunately, the vast ideals of the Archon are too great for mortals to perceive, and resentment arises nonetheless, with some even uniting to resist those who enforce the decree.",
                "In such circumstances, where she has no choice but to take action, Sara often sighs helplessly before facing the enemy."

                "Surveying battle lines, setting up training plans, selecting weapons and armor... Unlike many generals who prefer to strategize and plan from the rear, Sara prefers to do such things herself.",
                "Sara is very harsh on herself during training, with her personal regimen being over ten times tougher than that which the ordinary troops go through. Even when night has fallen and the world has gone to sleep, one can still hear the sounds of her bow being drawn echoing through the dojo.",
                "On the battlefield, she has always been at the tip of the spear, leading the troops with absolute heroism and awe-inspiring fighting spirit.",
                "When the dust has settled, she will also personally see to the wounded, and give reward and mete out punishment based on merit. Every step of the battle that passes through her hands is managed well, with missteps being very few and far between.",
                "Sara's troops are all witnesses to her words and deeds. No one who has fought alongside her does not hold her in the highest regard.",
                "The general is the soul of the army, and fine generals are hard to find. Small wonder, then, that Sara has always been the pride of the Shogun's Army."

                "She views excellence in such matters to also be a part of her training, and handles them herself, not requiring the aid of any servants.",

                "Although she has grown up amongst humans, Sara still maintains the various habits of the tengu. When she leaves the Tenryou Commission Headquarters on occasion, it is mostly to go to the mountains.",
                "She knows them like the back of her hand, and has witnessed many strange creatures not often told of in human tales.",
                "Among them are many fierce and evil things, but there are also little creatures that mean no harm. To Sara, however, these are just differences in form.",
                "There was a time when a sizable spate of thefts was reported to the police station in quick succession, and they could not find the culprit. Walking through the woods on higher alert than usual, Sara quickly espied the bake-danuki running along hurriedly while carrying their plunder.",
                "Of course, bake-danuki are not evil by nature, but only steal food out of gluttony.",
                "Capturing the creatures, Sara had only this to say as she reclaimed their ill-gotten gains:",

                "The bake-danuki were chilled to the bone, nodding as they balled up in a corner. After this, they would keep to that agreement and did not again do such ill.",
                "As for the sharp-tongued Sara, she would bring various melons and fruits that could keep for a longer period up to the mountains while training there, making sure to deposit them in the bake-danuki's dwelling whenever she passed through.",
                "She did not explain herself, and in any case, did not consider this any sort of gift. If she had to describe it... then perhaps a sort of consolation to those who had turned from an unrighteous path might be the best description for such things."

                "Sara has been training with the Shogun's Army ever since she was taken in by the Tenryou Commission. The soldiers actually thought that she was a boy at first due to her coming to train at an early age, and they took care of her very well.",
                "Having been a little frightened of crowds at first, Sara became much more outgoing due to this warm reception, and would even play games with the other troops.",
                "However, the soldiers she played alongside were severely punished by the Clan Head, while she was merely given a cold chastening.",
                "\"Not following military law and neglecting your training... I did not take you in just to have you do such pointless things.\"",
                "Since then, Sara would be conscientious in maintaining a certain distance from others. Rather than blending in with the crowd, she sought first to attain surpassing martial prowess, bearing in mind at all times that she would someday take command.",

                "No one ever told her that she should give herself more consideration, and Sara did not necessarily lack such concerns either.",
                "Her chains as an adopted child and the solitude of a non-human had always accompanied her mission and status.",
                "But to stop due to such obstacles is the dilemma of the weak, and being Kujou Sara, her path would not end here. She would be the Electro Archon's staunchest adherent and the most clear-headed of her generals."

                "In all matters related to the Shogun, she had never once committed a perfunctory or negligent act. Indeed, she went forth personally to select and purchase a statue and even personally prepared a shrine within which it might be kept upon her return.",
                "She placed five such statues in specially-placed display cases, and would clean them whenever she returned home. If she could not be there, she would arrange for artisans to perform that maintenance instead...",
