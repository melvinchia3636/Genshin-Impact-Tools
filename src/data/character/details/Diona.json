She despises just about anyone who indulges in alcohol, apart from Lisa and Eula.\n",

Unfortunately, her friend blessed her with a magic touch that makes all of her drinks delicious, regardless of how noxious the ingredients used are, and she herself is unaware of this.\n",

She worries over the Traveler's ability to get home safely without night vision and offers to escort them home until they remind her that street lamps exist, and she quickly denies ever having offered escorting them. She blames Diluc for her father's problems, even though the Dawn Winery had existed well before him or his father, and fails to see why the fans she and Barbara gets are drastically different. She also appears to crave companionship, implied to be a result of Draff neglecting her when he's in his drunken stupors.\n"
