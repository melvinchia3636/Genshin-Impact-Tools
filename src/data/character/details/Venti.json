            "content": "Venti is a playable Anemo  character in Genshin Impact. He is a free-spirited, wine-loving bard in Mondstadt and the current mortal vessel of Barbatos, the Anemo Archon. He first appears during the Archon Quest Prologue: Act I - The Outlander Who Caught the Wind."

            "content": [
                "Venti has a somewhat recalcitrant, carefree, and playful attitude as well as a liking to rhyming in his speech. He sees a particular worth in music to the point where he names his lyre, saying, \"every being deserves a name to be called upon, and woven into a song.\" He is also bold, not fearing to insult or ignore those who are supposedly powerful. In the game, he responds to Paimon's comments and nicknaming by parroting her.\n",
                "Venti enjoys roaming around Mondstadt playing songs to his people, most of whom are unaware of his true identity as Barbatos. He is very well-liked due to his musical talent, having won the title \"Most Popular Bard of Mondstadt\" three times. Venti is also an avid drinker of alcoholic beverages, such as Dandelion Wine and has a high tolerance to alcohol. He is also fine with apple cider. To his disdain, the form he takes causes most bartenders to see him as a minor.\n",
                "Being a god who is generally absent for prolonged periods of time, Venti has no personal finances; he often resorts to pilfering from the Dawn Winery for food and shamelessly has people listening to his songs buy him drinks in lieu of a payment. For reasons unknown, he is deathly allergic to cats and will not perform unless he is certain none are nearby. In his story quest, it is implied that his constant alcoholism is his way of coping with the loss of a dear friend.\n",
                "He also enjoys apples, considering them to be the fruit of the gods, jokingly stating that he would refuse to go to Celestia even if he was invited because their apples are bland and the water foul, which would make bad cider. He dislikes cheese, claiming it to be a smelly, sticky and slimy mess.\n",
                "Despite his normally playful personality as the bard Venti, he speaks wisely and somewhat philosophically whenever he assumes his true identity due to the many experiences he had being one of the original members of The Seven. Compared to Zhongli, the mortal vessel of Morax, Venti does not mind revealing his identity and using his powers if it means helping his people.\n",
                "For all his cheer and wisdom, Venti hides a lonely soul who, even millennia later, continues to feel strongly about the loss of the Bard whose form he imitates and even compares himself to Stanley (a man whose real name is Hans Archibald but took on the name of his deceased friend Stanley and tried to imitate him).\n",
                "Venti also confesses to finding the Traveler's ability to discern what he's thinking as discomforting, but admits that he appreciates having a true friend, similar to how he views the Bard.\n"

        "appearance": [
            "Venti appears as a young boy with fair skin and a slim build. Similar to the Anemo element, his eyes are aqua green which also resembles the sky and the grass. He has dark blue hair that borders on black, with short twin braids that fade into aqua at the tips. The aqua tips glow neon when he uses his abilities. The form he currently takes is modeled after a deceased friend who perished to liberate Old Mondstadt. This appearance is used for his Statues of the Seven around Mondstadt and the larger statue in the plaza in front of the Favonius Cathedral.\n",
            "He wears a frilly white top with a corset-like leather midsection, along with teal shorts with gold embroidery, a matching teal cape held together by a deep blue and gold bow. He also wears white stockings with three gold diamond shapes along each leg and a beret-like hat with a Cecilia, which is his favorite flower. He carries a wooden lyre with blue strings and cecilias imbued with the power of Anemo. This wooden lyre is also called \"Der Fr\u00fchling\", and it is the current lyre he carries since his other lyre \"Der Himmel\" is held by the Church. Because he is an Archon with an innate Gnosis, the \"Vision\" on his hip is no more than \"a glass ball [he carries] around to avoid suspicion.\" His outfit, Breezy Ode, is described to be an outfit of a carefree bard.\n"

                "When channeling Anemo, it appears in the form of out-stretched feathers, because he likes things that look light."
            ],
            "Story 1": [
                "Back when traveling bard Venti had only been in **Mondstadt** for a few months, his income was far less than the other more established bards in town. But once he had a few **Mora** in the pot from his performance, you could be sure he would hurry off to spend it at the same place every time - one of the city's taverns.",
                "Unfortunately for Venti, his childlike appearance meant that his attempts to acquire alcohol failed at every turn.",
                "The first time he was refused service, he was heard grumbling: \"I'm sure there were no such preposterous regulations last time I was here...\" Once he realized that the same rule applied to all taverns in town, he decided he would have to change his approach...\nThe strategy he developed was drinking on the job - that is to say, playing the lyre while holding his wine cup in his mouth, urging his audience to buy him a drink from the bar if they liked his performance instead of giving him Mora.",
                "The novelty of this made him quite popular in Mondstadt.",
                "There was just one snag&mdash;he couldn't help but sneeze if a cat came close...",
                "And if he happened to be holding a wine cup in his mouth when it happened... needless to say, it would spell disaster.",
                "Venti, therefore, has one golden rule when selecting a spot to perform, and that is that there must be no cats in the vicinity.",
                "Easier said than done&mdash;the stray cats of Mondstadt seem to be quite drawn to him."
            ],
            "Story 2": [
                "There is a towering oak tree at the center of **Windrise**, said to have sprouted when **Vennessa** ascended to the heavens a millennium ago.",
                "In the past few months, travelers resting in the shade of the great oak sometimes hear a young boy singing the tales of **Barbatos**, the Anemo Archon.",
                "Unlike the ruling deities of other nations, Barbatos has long left Mondstadt. In fact, the only visible proof of his connection with Mondstadt is the **Statue of The Seven|Statues of The Seven** that appear across the land&mdash;and even then, the resemblance is vague at best. Fortunately, Barbatos' past deeds are recorded in books and epics, sung and passed on by the bards.",
                "In contrast to these more canonical works, Venti's ballads tend to include bizarre adventures and acts of mischief, such as the time that Barbatos pinched the **Tsaritsa|Cryo Archon**'s scepter and replaced it with a hilichurl's wooden club...",
                "Worshippers of Barbatos are quick to decry these frivolous tales as blasphemous fabrications.  But whenever someone confronts Venti about this, his response suggests that he has not an ounce of remorse.",
                "\"How can you know that they're fabrications?\"",
                "He has a point&mdash;even the most devoted nun could not possibly know the details of all Barbatos' deeds from a millennium ago.",
                "Only Venti knows the truth behind his song lyrics, and it is a truth he hides behind an enigmatic smile.",
                "Reason being, yes; Venti's tall tales of Barbatos' unorthodox exploits are entirely fabricated.",
                "Hey, Venti finds that a few drinks really get his muse going.",

                "Around 2,600 years ago, the **Archon War** had yet to end, and the world had yet to fall under the dominion of **The Seven**.",
                "In those days, the city called \"Mondstadt\" was surrounded on all sides by gales impenetrable even to the birds of the air. Their ceaseless howling ground the soil and rock of that city into smooth, flowing dust.",
                "The Lord of Wind who lived in his high tower was **Decarabian**, God of Storms. He squinted from on high at his subjects, who bowed before him in unceasing wind, and, believing them submissive, thought this good.",
                "In those days, Venti was but a single thread of the thousand winds that roared through the northern lands.",
                "He who would in latter days be known as \"Barbatos\" was but a tiny elemental spirit, without a shred of divine dignity, a breeze that brought subtle changes for the better, or tiny seeds of hope. In Mondstadt of old, Venti met a **Nameless Bard|young boy**. This lad knew how to play the lyre, and longed to write the greatest poem of all.",
                "\"I do so wish to see the birds in flight.\"",
                "So said the boy who had never seen the blue sky, eagles, or the green grass, his voice almost utterly drowned by the wind.",

                "With the feather tucked away in his breast pocket, Venti watched the fall of the eccentric ruler amid the wrack and ruin of revolt together with his friend.",
                "The ruler had believed that he had given his subjects a city free from the bitter cold, and to the end, he believed that they had loved him as he loved them.",
                "Yet, despite the victory, Venti was never able to give that feather to the lad, for that lad had fallen in the battle for the sake of song, sky, and birds, and for the people who, like him, had dwelled within the storm-wall. With the crumbling of an ancient seat of divinity, a new god was born. The Anemo Archon Barbatos felt power flowing at his fingertips.",
                "His first use of this power was to reconstitute himself in the likeness of that young lad.",
                "For only if he wore human shape could he play the lyre that the lad so loved.",
                "Plucking its strings, he scattered the ice and snow and split the mountains with a divine wind.",
                "He bade Mondstadt become a city of freedom, a nation without a king.",
                "In future, he believed, it would become a better, more romantic city.",

                "After 1,600 years of history, Mondstadt's \"freedom\" had sunk to a heretofore unseen low. Barbatos, unwilling to become a tyrant, had departed. But he had never imagined that those to whom he had gifted freedom would make for themselves a tyrant.",
                "The aristocracy ruled Mondstadt with a cruel hand, bringing slaves into this land and ignoring the cries of the oppressed.",
                "Thus the Anemo Archon returned after these 1,600 years to what was once the City of Freedom. He heard the cry of the slave girl **Vennessa**, and together with her raised a rebellion that overthrew the aristocracy.",

                "The story has an interesting, little-known twist, however. The one who united the people of Mondstadt in this conflict was indeed the hero Vennessa&mdash;but that which caused many of the aristocracy's troops to turn coat was a \"treachery against the wind.\"",
                "A secret treaty was found, a betrayal of the city&mdash;the aristocrats had forsaken the wind, and sold everything in Mondstadt to the Geo Archon of the neighboring land.",

                "The news, and the conflict, spread like wildfire, consuming the aristocracy. It was only many years later that historians would discover that this treaty was fake.",
                "As it turned out, Venti had once practiced the art of forgery in order to play pranks on the Geo Archon, but would never deceive the god of wealth and transactions. Even so, his adeptness would come into play after several hundred years.",
